    "response": "Based on your clinical data, you have been diagnosed with primary acute angle-closure glaucoma in your left eye. This condition is characterized by a sudden increase in eye pressure due to the angle of your eye closing, which can lead to pain and blurred vision. Your records indicate that you experienced sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in your left eye, along with eye redness, photophobia, tearing, headache, and nausea.\n\nWhile your clinical data confirms the diagnosis and the acute nature of your condition, it does not contain specific information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye. The long-term outcome for primary acute angle-closure glaucoma can vary depending on several factors, including how quickly the condition was treated, the extent of any damage to the optic nerve, and your response to treatment. Your ophthalmologist will be able to discuss your specific long-term prognosis with you after further evaluation and monitoring of your eye's condition and response to the care you received during your admission.\n\nIt is important to continue with all recommended follow-up appointments and adhere to any prescribed treatments to manage your glaucoma and help preserve your vision. Your doctor will monitor your eye pressure and optic nerve health to guide your ongoing care.",

        "ClinicalHistory": "Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in the left eye for 4 days.\nHistory of Present Illness: Four days ago, the patient experienced sudden onset of distending pain in the left eye without obvious precipitating factors, accompanied by a rapid decrease in vision. Both distant and near vision were unclear, accompanied by irritative symptoms such as eye redness, photophobia, and tearing, as well as ipsilateral headache and nausea. Denied history of ocular trauma. Due to persistent unremitting symptoms, the patient came to our hospital today for treatment. After relevant examinations in the outpatient clinic, the patient was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of \"1. Primary acute angle-closure glaucoma in the left eye; 2. Bilateral pseudophakia.\" During the course of the illness, there was no fever or cough. Appetite and sleep were poor, but bowel movements and urination were normal.\nPast Medical History and Surgical/Trauma History: General condition: Generally healthy. Denied history of chronic diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease; denied history of blood transfusion and trauma.

Denied known allergies to sulfonamides, streptomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, cephalosporins, other medications, or food.\nOphthalmic Examination: Vod 0.4 Vos 0.1. IOP OD Tn OS T+2. Right eye: conjunctiva without hyperemia, cornea clear, peripheral anterior chamber shallow, aqueous humor clear, pupil round, diameter approximately 3mm, light reflex (+), lens turbid, fundus visible with retina attached, no obvious hemorrhage or exudation seen. Left eye: conjunctival mixed hyperemia (++), corneal opacity and edema, subepithelial bullae, KP (-), anterior chamber shallow, peripheral anterior chamber <1/3 CT, aqueous flare (+), pupil round, diameter approximately 4mm, light reflex (+), lens turbid, fundus view obscured.",
        "DifferentialDiagnosis": "1. Acute iridocyclitis: Sudden onset of eye redness, eye pain, varying degrees of vision loss, intraocular pressure often not elevated, significant anterior chamber inflammatory reaction, pupil constricted and irregular in shape.\n2. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis: Patients are mostly young and middle-aged adults, intraocular pressure sharply increases, local irritation symptoms are relatively mild, anterior chamber is not shallow, angle is open, with mutton-fat keratic precipitates on the posterior cornea."
