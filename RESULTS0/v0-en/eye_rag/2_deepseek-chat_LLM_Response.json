    "response": "Based on your clinical data, I can provide you with specific lifestyle recommendations to help manage your eye condition and prevent further damage. Your diagnosis is **left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma** and **left eye senile cataract**, which requires careful management to protect your vision.\n\n**Key Lifestyle Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Medication Adherence**: This is the most critical aspect. You must take all prescribed glaucoma medications exactly as directed by your ophthalmologist. These medications help control your intraocular pressure (IOP), which was significantly elevated in your left eye (T+2). Missing doses can lead to sudden pressure spikes and permanent vision loss.\n\n2. **Regular Follow-up Appointments**: Given your acute angle-closure glaucoma episode, you need regular monitoring. Your ophthalmologist will need to check your eye pressure, assess your optic nerve health, and monitor your visual field. These appointments are essential for detecting any progression early.\n\n3. **Avoid Triggers for Angle Closure**: Certain activities and medications can trigger angle-closure attacks:\n   - **Avoid medications** that dilate your pupils, including some over-the-counter cold medications, antidepressants, and motion sickness drugs. Always inform any healthcare provider about your glaucoma diagnosis before taking new medications.\n   - **Be cautious in dim lighting** as this can cause pupil dilation.\n   - **Avoid excessive fluid intake** at one time, as this can temporarily increase eye pressure.\n\n4. **Eye Protection**: Since you have cataracts in both eyes, protect your eyes from ultraviolet light by wearing sunglasses with UV protection when outdoors. This can help slow cataract progression.\n\n5. **Healthy Lifestyle**: While not directly treating glaucoma, maintaining overall health is important:\n   - **Regular, moderate exercise** (with your doctor's approval) may help with eye pressure control\n   - **Avoid smoking**, as it can worsen eye conditions\n   - **Maintain a healthy diet** rich in antioxidants (leafy greens, colorful fruits and vegetables)\n\n6. **Stress Management**: Your clinical history mentions poor appetite and sleep during your acute episode. Stress can potentially affect eye pressure, so finding healthy ways to manage stress through relaxation techniques, adequate sleep, and social support is beneficial.\n\n7. **Vision Monitoring**: Pay attention to any changes in your vision, such as increased blurriness, halos around lights, eye pain, or redness. These could indicate another acute episode and require immediate medical attention.\n\n**Important Note**: Your condition requires ongoing medical management. Lifestyle changes complement but do not replace medical treatment. The acute angle-closure episode you experienced required hospitalization, indicating the seriousness of your condition. Always follow your ophthalmologist's specific recommendations regarding medications, follow-up frequency, and any activity restrictions.\n\nGiven your age (79) and the presence of cataracts in both eyes, your ophthalmologist may discuss cataract surgery in the future, which can sometimes help with glaucoma management by improving drainage angles. However, this decision should be made in consultation with your eye care specialist based on your specific examination findings.",

        "ClinicalHistory": "Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in the left eye for 4 days.\nHistory of Present Illness: Four days ago, the patient experienced sudden onset of distending pain in the left eye without obvious precipitating factors, accompanied by a rapid decrease in vision. Both distant and near vision were unclear, accompanied by irritative symptoms such as eye redness, photophobia, and tearing, as well as ipsilateral headache and nausea. Denies history of ocular trauma. As symptoms persisted without relief, the patient came to our hospital today for treatment. After relevant examinations in the outpatient clinic, the patient was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of \"1. Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma; 2. Bilateral pseudophakia.\" During the course of the illness, there was no fever or cough. Appetite and sleep were poor, but bowel movements and urination were normal.\nPast Medical History and Surgical/Trauma History: General condition: Usually in general good health. Denies history of chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease; denies history of blood transfusion or trauma. Denies history of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, bacillary dysentery, and typhoid fever. Immunizations completed on schedule. Denies allergies to sulfonamide drugs, streptomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, cephalosporins, other medications, or any known food allergies.\nOphthalmic Examination: Vod 0.4, Vos 0.1. IOP OD Tn, OS T+2. Right eye: conjunctiva without hyperemia, cornea clear, peripheral anterior chamber shallow, aqueous humor clear, pupil round with a diameter of approximately 3mm, reactive to light (+), lens turbid, fundus visible with retina attached, no obvious hemorrhage or exudation seen. Left eye: conjunctival mixed hyperemia (++), corneal opacity and edema, subepithelial bullae, KP (-), anterior chamber shallow, peripheral anterior chamber <1/3 CT, aqueous flare (+), pupil round with a diameter of approximately 4mm, reactive to light (+), lens turbid, fundus not visible.",
        "DifferentialDiagnosis": "1. Acute iridocyclitis: Sudden onset of eye redness, eye pain, varying degrees of vision loss, intraocular pressure usually not elevated, significant anterior chamber inflammatory reaction, pupil constricted and irregular in shape.\n2. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis: Patients are mostly young and middle-aged adults, acute sharp increase in intraocular pressure, local irritation symptoms are mild, anterior chamber is not shallow, open angle, mutton-fat KPs on the posterior cornea."
