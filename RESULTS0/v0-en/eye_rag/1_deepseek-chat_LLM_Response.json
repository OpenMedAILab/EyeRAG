    "response": "Based on your clinical data, I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nThe long-term prognosis for primary acute angle-closure glaucoma depends on several factors, including how quickly the condition was treated, the extent of optic nerve damage that occurred during the acute attack, and how well your intraocular pressure (IOP) is controlled going forward. With appropriate treatment and management, many patients can preserve their remaining vision and prevent further damage.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYour clinical information shows that you experienced a sudden onset of symptoms in your left eye for 4 days before seeking treatment. At admission, your left eye showed significant signs of acute angle-closure glaucoma including:\n- Very high intraocular pressure (documented as T+2, indicating significantly elevated pressure)\n- Corneal edema and opacity with subepithelial bullae\n- Shallow anterior chamber\n- Aqueous flare (indicating inflammation)\n- Reduced vision in the left eye (Vos 0.1 compared to 0.4 in the right eye)\n\n**Educational Information:**\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma is an ocular emergency where the drainage angle of the eye suddenly becomes blocked, causing a rapid increase in intraocular pressure. This high pressure can damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting visual information to your brain. The extent of vision loss depends on:\n1. How long the pressure remained elevated before treatment\n2. The peak pressure reached during the attack\n3. Your individual susceptibility to pressure-related damage\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps:**\nTo optimize your long-term prognosis, several important steps are necessary:\n1. **Immediate treatment** to lower the intraocular pressure (which you received during your hospitalization)\n2. **Definitive treatment** to prevent future attacks, typically involving laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) to create a new drainage pathway\n3. **Regular follow-up** to monitor intraocular pressure and optic nerve health\n4. **Possible cataract surgery** since you also have senile cataract, which can sometimes help with angle-closure management\n5. **Evaluation of your right eye** since angle-closure glaucoma often affects both eyes, and preventive treatment may be recommended\n\nThe vision you lost during the acute attack may not fully recover, but with proper management, you can prevent further vision loss and preserve your remaining vision. Your prognosis will be better determined after your eye has stabilized from the acute episode and you've received definitive preventive treatment.\n\nIt's important to attend all follow-up appointments, use any prescribed medications as directed, and report any new symptoms immediately to your ophthalmologist.",

        "DischargeDiagnosis": "1. Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma; 2. Left eye senile cataract",
        "ClinicalHistory": "Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in the left eye for 4 days.\nHistory of Present Illness: Four days ago, the patient experienced sudden onset of distending pain in the left eye without obvious precipitating factors, accompanied by a rapid decrease in vision. Both distant and near vision were unclear, accompanied by irritative symptoms such as eye redness, photophobia, and tearing, as well as ipsilateral headache and nausea. Denied history of ocular trauma. Due to persistent unremitting symptoms, the patient came to our hospital today for treatment. After relevant examinations in the outpatient clinic, the patient was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of \"1. Primary acute angle-closure glaucoma in the left eye; 2. Bilateral pseudophakia.\" During the course of the illness, there was no fever or cough. Appetite and sleep were poor, but bowel movements and urination were normal.\nPast Medical History and Surgical/Trauma History: General condition: Generally healthy. Denied history of chronic diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease; denied history of blood transfusion and trauma. Denied history of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, bacillary dysentery, and typhoid fever. Immunizations were completed on schedule. Denied known allergies to sulfonamides, streptomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, cephalosporins, other medications, or food.\nOphthalmic Examination: Vod 0.4 Vos 0.1. IOP OD Tn OS T+2. Right eye: conjunctiva without hyperemia, cornea clear, peripheral anterior chamber shallow, aqueous humor clear, pupil round, diameter approximately 3mm, light reflex (+), lens turbid, fundus visible with retina attached, no obvious hemorrhage or exudation seen. Left eye: conjunctival mixed hyperemia (++), corneal opacity and edema, subepithelial bullae, KP (-), anterior chamber shallow, peripheral anterior chamber <1/3 CT, aqueous flare (+), pupil round, diameter approximately 4mm, light reflex (+), lens turbid, fundus view obscured.",
        "DifferentialDiagnosis": "1. Acute iridocyclitis: Sudden onset of eye redness, eye pain, varying degrees of vision loss, intraocular pressure often not elevated, significant anterior chamber inflammatory reaction, pupil constricted and irregular in shape.\n2. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis: Patients are mostly young and middle-aged adults, intraocular pressure sharply increases, local irritation symptoms are relatively mild, anterior chamber is not shallow, angle is open, with mutton-fat keratic precipitates on the posterior cornea."
