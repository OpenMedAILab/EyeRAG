    "response": "Based on your recent diagnosis of left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and left eye senile cataract, there are several lifestyle considerations that can help manage your conditions and potentially prevent further damage.\n\nFor your cataract, while there's no definitive evidence for high-dose antioxidant supplements, a well-balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables is a reasonable recommendation. Engaging in long-term physical activity and exercise may also decrease the risk of cataract progression, while prolonged inactivity might be associated with it. It's also important to note that smoking is a risk factor for cataracts, and quitting can reduce the risk of development or progression. Additionally, managing conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, if present, can reduce the risk of cataracts.\n\nRegarding your acute angle-closure glaucoma, it's important to be aware of certain medications that can potentially cause ciliary body edema and angle narrowing, such as sulfonamides (including topiramate) and drugs with adrenergic or anticholinergic effects (like ipratropium bromide and salbutamol-containing inhalers, and phenothiazines). You should always inform your ophthalmologist about all medications you are taking. While your age and female gender are identified as risk factors for primary angle-closure disease, these are not modifiable. The primary goal for glaucoma management is to preserve your visual function and maintain your quality of life, which will involve ongoing care and monitoring by your ophthalmologist.",

            "content": "## MANAGEMENT\n### Prevention\nPreventive measures that impart even a modest decrease in the risk of cataract could have a large public health impact, given that 24.4 million people over the age of 40 years in the United States are affected by cataract.\nThe role of diet and antioxidant supplements has been studied with mixed conclusions. A 2012 Cochrane Systematic Review of nine randomized controlled trials found no evidence to support high doses of vitamin E, vitamin C, or beta-carotene in preventing development or progression of cataract.\nA more recent systematic review about the role of nutrient supplementation on lens pathology found that vitamin C, beta-carotene, and lutein and zeaxanthin had a protective effect against cataract, but this analysis included observational data.\nThere is currently no level 1 evidence to suggest that high-dose antioxidant supplementation slows cataract progression. There is moderate evidence that a multivitamin/mineral supplement may decrease the risk of cataract.\nSeveral observational studies also demonstrate the potential benefit of a healthy diet in preventing cataract.\nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support a specific diet, but a well-balanced diet rich with fruits and vegetables is a reasonable recommendation based on observational studies. Appendix 3 summarizes studies of nutrition and cataract.\nLong-term increased physical activity and exercise may decrease the risk of cataract. Additionally, long periods of inactivity and prolonged sitting may be associated with cataract progression.\nThe effect of medications on the formation of cataract is difficult to study since the effect of the medication is hard to distinguish from the effect of the disease being treated. Long-term users of inhaled or oral corticosteroids are at higher risk of cataract formation. The use of intranasal corticosteroids, however, is not associated with a significant risk of incident cataract based on two recent systematic reviews.\nThe association between statin use and cataract has been studied extensively with conflicting results.\nPhenothiazines have been associated with anterior subcapsular opacities. Multiple studies show no benefit of aspirin on cataract development or the need for cataract surgery.\nThere is a long list of drugs that may be associated with cataract in prevalence studies, but longitudinal studies are needed to confirm a causative relationship. Patients on medications who are at high risk for cataract formation should be counseled and monitored.\nThe presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia) is associated with an increased risk of cataract or cataract surgery in numerous observational studies. Prevention and treatment of these conditions may reduce the risk of cataract.\nSmoking is a risk factor for various types of cataracts, with a dose-response effect seen for nuclear sclerosis. Cessation of smoking reduces the risk of cataract development or progression and cataract surgery, and patients should be counseled to quit smoking.\n## Nonsurgical Management\nThe management of visually significant cataract is primarily surgical. However, there are nonsurgical means for managing the symptoms of cataract before surgery is necessary.\nChanges to glasses and contact lens prescriptions can often be made to account for refractive shifts in the early stages of cataract development. Low-vision devices can maximize remaining vision pending cataract surgery or allow surgery to be deferred in patients at high risk of complications.\nCurrently, no pharmacological treatments are known to eliminate existing cataract or retard its progression. Ophthalmologists should advise patients that, at this time, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacological treatments for cataract, based on a 2017 Cochrane Systematic Review of N-acetylcarnosine drops.\nPatients who are long-term users of topical ophthalmic, periocular, oral, and inhaled corticosteroids should be informed of the increased risk of cataract development and may wish to discuss alternative treatments with their primary care physician. In limited circumstances, and often as a temporizing measure, the pupil can be dilated to provide better vision around a small central cataract. However, this strategy may worsen glare disability."

Fifty-eight percent of eyes had visual acuity worse than 20/40. Thus, AACC (and subsequent PACG) creates significant visual morbidity with progressive vision loss that may result in unilateral and bilateral blindness.\n## CARE PROCESS\n### PATIENT OUTCOME CRITERIA\n- Preservation of visual function\n- Maintenance of quality of life\n- Reduction of the risk of AACC\n### DIAGNOSIS\nPatients may or may not have symptoms of PACD. Primary angle-closure suspect is a diagnosis based on the presence of ITC on gonioscopy only, without elevated IOP or PAS and no optic nerve damage. Primary angle closure is based on a combination of the presence of ITC on gonioscopy with either elevated IOP or PAS, but no glaucomatous optic neuropathy.<sup>9</sup>\nPatients may be asymptomatic when presenting for routine eye care, or they may present with sudden onset of symptoms and signs typical of AACC (such as pain, nausea, redness, congestion, decreased vision, corneal edema, very high IOP). The initial history and ophthalmic examination includes the components of the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation,<sup>92</sup> with special attention to those elements that specifically bear on primary and secondary causes of angle closure (see below).\n## History\nThe patient with PACD should be asked about previous symptoms of intermittent angle closure (e.g., blurred vision, halos around lights, eye pain, headache, eye redness). These symptoms may occur spontaneously or with pharmacologic stress, such as ingestion or transdermal absorption of anticholinergics or installation of mydriatic eye drops. Review of the patient’s family history may identify a relative with AACC. The ophthalmologist should also inquire about the use of systemic medications that may cause ciliary body edema and angle narrowing (e.g., sulfonamides, including topiramate) and drugs with adrenergic or anticholinergic effects (e.g., ipratropium bromide and salbutamol-containing inhalers, phenothiazines)."
