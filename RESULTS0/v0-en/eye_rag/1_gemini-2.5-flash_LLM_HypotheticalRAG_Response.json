    "response": "Based on your clinical data, you have been diagnosed with primary acute angle-closure glaucoma in your left eye, along with a senile cataract. You experienced sudden onset of pain and blurred vision in your left eye, accompanied by redness, photophobia, tearing, headache, and nausea.\n\nRegarding the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma, it's important to understand that glaucoma is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management. The goal of treatment is to monitor or lower your intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent further damage to your optic nerve and preserve your vision. Your ophthalmologist will establish a target IOP that is individualized for you, aiming to keep it at a level where further optic nerve damage is unlikely.\n\nAfter initial treatment, follow-up evaluations are crucial. Your doctor will regularly check for changes in your eye, such as the extent of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) or any progression of your cataract, which can affect the angle of your eye. If your IOP remains elevated long-term, ongoing medical therapy to lower it may be necessary. The frequency of your follow-up appointments will depend on your clinical findings and your ophthalmologist's judgment.\n\nIt's important to adhere to any prescribed medical therapy, as consistent use of eyedrops can be challenging, especially if vision is impaired. Glaucomatous vision loss can significantly impact daily activities like reading, walking, and driving, and can affect your quality of life. Therefore, regular monitoring and adherence to your treatment plan are essential to manage your condition and minimize its impact on your well-being. If you experience substantial visual impairment, vision rehabilitation and social services can be beneficial.",

            "content": "## Follow-up Evaluation\nThe recommendations for follow-up evaluations after iridotomy for angle closure apply to ongoing management of PACD and not to visits for other purposes. Following LPI, patients may have an open anterior chamber angle or an anterior chamber angle with a combination of open sectors with areas occluded by PAS. With or without glaucomatous optic neuropathy, patients with a residual open angle or a combination of open angle and some PAS should be followed at appropriate intervals to check for increasing PAS. Special attention should be given to repeat gonioscopy to determine interval changes such as increased extent of PAS or development of secondary angle closure from cataract progression and increased lens thickness. Subsequent follow-up intervals depend on the clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist.\nIf IOP remains elevated long term and the patient develops PAC or PACG, then ongoing medical therapy to lower IOP may become necessary. In such a situation, follow-up procedures and intervals would be dictated by the same principles outlined in the Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma PPP. As in primary open-angle glaucoma, adherence to medical therapy may be handicapped when patients run out of medication, due to inadvertent drop wastage or inability to properly instill eyedrops, before they are permitted to refill their prescription. One study found this was more likely for patients who self-administered eyedrop medications when visual acuity was worse than 20/70 in either eye. However, according to a 2010 directive, patients with Medicare insurance may now refill their medication after they have completed at least 70% of the month, or approximately 21 days of therapy.\n## PROVIDER AND SETTING\nThe performance of certain diagnostic procedures (e.g., tonometry, perimetry, pachymetry, anterior segment imaging, optic disc imaging, and photography) may be delegated to appropriately trained and supervised personnel. However, the interpretation of results and medical and surgical management of disease require the medical training, clinical judgment, and experience of the ophthalmologist. Most diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be undertaken safely on an outpatient basis. Hospitalization may be indicated for intensive treatment of an AACC so that patients can be monitored closely after surgical procedures associated with a high risk of serious short-term postoperative complications. It may also be indicated for patients who have experienced surgical complications or for patients who have special medical or social needs.\n## COUNSELING AND REFERRAL\nIf the diagnosis or management of PACD is in question or is refractory to treatment, consultation with or referral to an ophthalmologist with special training or experience in managing these conditions may be indicated. Patients with substantial visual impairment or blindness may benefit from appropriate vision rehabilitation and social services. More information on vision rehabilitation, including materials for patients, is available at [www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision](www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision).\n## SOCIOECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS\nAt the individual patient level, research has demonstrated that glaucomatous vision loss can have a dramatic impact on a patient’s well-being. Patients with glaucoma may struggle with daily activities such as reading, walking, and driving. Performance of these activities deteriorates with worsening of glaucoma severity and when both eyes are affected. Studies have reported that patients with glaucoma are three times more likely to experience falls and six times more likely to be involved in motor vehicle collisions compared with controls. Quality of life is affected for patients with all stages of glaucoma, even those with early disease.\nThe costs of managing a chronic disease like glaucoma can be broken down into direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs. Direct costs include costs of visits to eye care providers, ancillary testing, and medical and surgical interventions. One study estimated that nearly $3 billion USD per year is spent on the direct medical costs for all forms of glaucoma. Direct nonmedical"

            "content": "## INTRODUCTION\n### DISEASE DEFINITION\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy in adults in which there is a characteristic acquired atrophy of the optic nerve and loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. This condition is associated with an open anterior chamber angle by gonioscopy. Primary open-angle glaucoma is a potentially blinding eye disease, but early diagnosis and treatment can generally prevent visual disability.\n### CLINICAL FINDINGS CHARACTERISTIC OF PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma is a chronic ocular disease process that is progressive, generally bilateral, but often asymmetric. It is associated with the following characteristics:\n- **Evidence of optic nerve damage from either, or both, of the following:**\n  - Optic disc or retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) structural abnormalities:\n    - Diffuse or focal narrowing, or notching, of the optic disc rim, especially at the inferior or superior poles, which forms the basis for the ISNT rule (see subsection on optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer clinical examination in Physical Examination section)\n    - Progressive narrowing of the neuroretinal rim with an associated increase in cupping of the optic disc\n    - Diffuse or localized thinning of the parapapillary RNFL, especially at the inferior or superior poles. (Highly myopic individuals without glaucoma may have diffusely thin RNFL.)\n    - Optic disc hemorrhages involving the disc rim, parapapillary RNFL, or lamina cribrosa\n    - Optic disc neural rim asymmetry of the two eyes consistent with loss of neural tissue\n    - Beta-zone parapapillary atrophy\n    - Thinning of the RNFL and/or macula on imaging\n  - Reliable and reproducible visual field abnormality:\n    - Visual field damage consistent with RNFL damage (e.g., nasal step, arcuate field defect, or paracentral depression in clusters of test sites)\n    - Visual field loss across the horizontal midline in one hemifield that exceeds loss in the opposite hemifield (in early/moderate cases)\n    - Absence of other known explanations (e.g., optic disc drusen, optic nerve pit, retinal or neurological pathology)\n- **Adult onset**\n- **Open anterior chamber angles**\n- **Absence of other known explanations** (i.e., secondary glaucoma) for progressive glaucomatous optic nerve change (e.g., pigment dispersion syndrome, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, uveitis, trauma, and corticosteroid use)\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma represents a spectrum of disease in adults in which the susceptibility of the optic nerve to damage varies among patients. Although many patients with POAG present with elevated IOP, nearly 40% of those with otherwise characteristic POAG may not have elevated IOP measurements during office hours. The vast majority of patients with POAG have disc changes or disc and visual field changes, but there are cases where early visual field changes may develop before there are detectable changes to the optic nerve.\nThe severity of glaucoma damage can be estimated according to the following categories:\n- **Mild:** Definite optic disc, RNFL, or macular imaging abnormalities consistent with glaucoma as detailed above and a normal visual field as tested with standard automated perimetry (SAP)\n- **Moderate:** Definite optic disc, RNFL, or macular imaging abnormalities consistent with glaucoma as detailed above, and visual field abnormalities in one hemifield that are not within 5 degrees of fixation\n## PATIENT POPULATION\nThe patient population consists of adults with open anterior chamber angles and demonstrated optic nerve or RNFL damage, and/or visual field loss.\n## CLINICAL OBJECTIVES\n- Document the status of the optic nerve structure at baseline by clinical evaluation and imaging, and document visual function by visual field testing\n- Estimate an IOP below which further optic nerve damage is unlikely to occur (see Target Intraocular Pressure subsection in the Care Process section)\n- Perform and document gonioscopy\n- Attempt to maintain IOP at or below a defined target level by initiating appropriate medical and/or surgical intervention(s) after discussing the options with the patient\n- Monitor the structure and function of the optic nerve for further damage and adjust the target IOP to a lower level if deterioration occurs\n- Minimize the side effects of treatment and their impact on the patient’s vision, general health, and quality of life\n- Educate and involve the patient and appropriate family members/caregivers in the management of the disease\n- Maintain quality of vision and preserve quality of life"

If visual field glaucomatous damage is newly detected in a glaucoma suspect patient, it is best to repeat testing.\n- ONH, RNFL, and macular imaging. Clinicians should include all perimetric and other structural information in addition to digital imaging technology when formulating patient management decisions.\n### Management Plan for Patients in Whom Therapy is Indicated\n- The goal of treatment is to monitor or lower IOP through treatment if an eye is likely to progress to POAG; monitor for structural changes in optic disc and retina; and monitor for functional changes of the optic nerve assessing the visual field.\n- The decision to treat a glaucoma suspect patient may arise in various settings (see POAG Suspect PPP for detailed considerations).\n- Target IOP is an estimate and must be individualized and/or adjusted during the course of the disease.\n- Medical therapy is presently the most common initial intervention to lower IOP (see Table 2 of the POAG Suspect PPP for an overview of options available); consider balance between side effects and effectiveness in choosing a regimen of maximal effectiveness and tolerance to achieve the desired IOP reduction for each patient.\n- If a medical therapy fails to reduce IOP sufficiently, then either switching to an alternative medication as monotherapy or adding additional medication is appropriate until the desired IOP level is attained.\n### Follow-up Exam History\n- Interval ocular history\n- Interval systemic medical and medication history\n- Side effects of ocular medications if the patient is being treated\n- Review of pertinent medication use if the patient is being treated, including the time of the last administration\n### Follow-up Physical Exam\n- Visual acuity measurement\n- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy\n- IOP measurement\n- Gonioscopy is indicated when there is a suspicion of development of an angle-closure component, anterior chamber shallowing, anterior chamber angle abnormalities, or unexplained change in IOP\n### Adjustment of Therapy\n- Target IOP is not achieved and the benefits of a change in therapy outweigh the risks for the patient\n- The patient is intolerant of the prescribed medical regimen\n- The patient does not adhere to the prescribed medical regimen due to costs or other factors\n- New systemic conditions or treatments develop that could be a contraindication to the current glaucoma therapy\n- The patient under treatment has been stable for a prolonged period without progression to POAG, in which case cautious withdrawal of therapy may be considered\n- The patient has converted to POAG (see Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma PPP)\n## Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Suspect (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation) (continued)\n### Patient Education\n- Discuss number and severity of risk factors, prognosis, life expectancy, management plan, and likelihood that therapy, once started, can be continued long term.\n- Educate about their condition and its potential to lead to glaucoma, the status of their condition, the rationale and goals of intervention, and relative benefits and risks of alternative interventions.\n- Educate about eyelid closure or nasolacrimal occlusion to reduce systemic absorption after medication instillation.\n- Encourage patients to alert their ophthalmologist to physical or emotional changes that occur when taking glaucoma medications.\n- Patients with substantial visual impairment or blindness can be referred for and encouraged to use appropriate vision rehabilitation and social services."
