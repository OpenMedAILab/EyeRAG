Increasing evidence suggests topical antibiotics do not add to the benefit of intracameral injections.\n### Preoperative Care\nThe ophthalmologist who is to perform the surgery has the following responsibilities:\n- Examine the patient preoperatively\n- Ensure that the evaluation accurately documents symptoms, findings, and indications for treatment\n- Inform the patient about the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery, including surgical experience and anticipated refractive outcome\n- Review results of presurgical and diagnostic evaluations with the patient\n- Counsel the patient about postoperative refractive options\n- Counsel the patient about elective refraction options and postoperative refractive enhancement\n- Consider effect of ocular comorbidities, including upper eyelid blepharoptosis\n- Formulate surgical plan, including preoperative management, selection of surgical approach, anesthesia, IOL design and power\n- Assess relevant aspects of the patient’s mental and physical status\n- Formulate postoperative plans and inform patient of arrangements\n- Answer the patient’s questions regarding surgery, care, and cost\n- Routine preoperative laboratory testing in association with the history and physical examination is not indicated\n### Follow-up Evaluation\n- Functionally monocular and high-risk patients should be seen within 24 hours of surgery.\n- Routine patients should be seen within 48 hours of surgery.\n- Frequency and timing of subsequent visits depend on size or configuration of the incision; need to cut or remove sutures; and when refraction, visual function, and medical condition of the eye are stabilized.\n- More frequent follow-up usually necessary for high-risk patients.\n- Components of each postoperative exam should include:\n  - Interval history, including new symptoms, use of postoperative medications and self-assessment of vision\n  - Measurement of visual function\n  - Measurement of IOP\n  - Slit-lamp biomicroscopy\n  - Counseling/education for the patient\n  - Provision of a management plan\n  - Operating ophthalmologist has ultimate responsibility for preoperative assessment and postoperative care of the patient and has a unique perspective and thorough understanding of the patient’s intraoperative course, postoperative condition and response to surgery. The operating ophthalmologist has an ethical obligation to the patient that continues until postoperative rehabilitation is complete. The operating ophthalmologist should provide postoperative care that is within the unique competence of the ophthalmologist. Patients should always have access to an ophthalmologist for appropriate care if serious problems arise."

            "content": "## Fellow-eye management\nThe fellow eye of a patient with AACC should be evaluated, because it is at high risk for a similar event. The fellow eye should be scheduled for a prophylactic LPI promptly if the chamber angle is anatomically narrow, since approximately half of fellow eyes of acute angle-closure patients can develop AACCs within 5 years. These attacks can occur within days of presentation and, therefore, an ophthalmologist should consider LPI in the fellow eye as soon as possible. Chronic parasympathomimetic therapy is not an appropriate alternative, either for prophylaxis of the fellow eye or for treatment of established angle closure, and it is not a substitute for iridotomy. About 40% of fellow eyes treated with parasympathomimetics can develop an AACC within 5 years, and many eyes with PACD can develop progressive formation of synechial angle closure with miotic use. Prophylactic LPIs are effective in preventing AACC in the fellow eye, although one study found that 53% of fellow eyes developed PACG after almost 6 years of follow-up, even after prophylactic LPI was performed.\n## Lens extraction for angle closure\nNumerous studies document that lens extraction significantly widens the anterior chamber angle in eyes that have PACD. In prospective and retrospective studies, cataract surgery also has been shown to lower postoperative medication requirements and decrease complications compared with iridectomy, iridotomy, or trabeculectomy for PACG and AACC. Although lens extraction with or without goniosynechialysis can substantially lower IOP, it has been documented that cataract extraction alone does not result in as low an IOP as cataract surgery combined with trabeculectomy. The risks and benefits of different procedures in eyes with angle closure should be considered when determining the most appropriate surgery.\nIn patients with AACC, phacoemulsification performed soon after initial medical reduction of IOP is effective in maintaining IOP control and reducing the need for glaucoma medications. However, cataract surgery in AACC eyes may have greater risk of operative complications due to the small dimensions of the anterior chamber and the tendency for choroidal expansion.\nThe EAGLE Study has recently shown the effectiveness of clear lens extraction with intraocular lens implantation for the treatment of PAC with elevated IOP (≥30 mm Hg at diagnosis) and PACG. This study found clear lens extraction to be superior to LPI for IOP control in PAC with elevated IOP and PACG; in addition, patients had better quality of life scores. Treatment with phacoemulsification was estimated to be cost-effective at 3 years and cost saving by 10 years in the United Kingdom.\n## Plateau Iris Configuration and Syndrome\nThe success of prophylactic laser iridoplasty after laser iridotomy to prevent PACG and AACC in eyes with plateau iris has been reported in a case series. However, a 2012 Cochrane review found no randomized controlled trials to provide evidence to support the use of this procedure in these eyes. Given the lack of convincing evidence in the literature for prophylactic use of iridoplasty in these patients, and since iridoplasty can be painful for the patient and may cause inflammation, the decision of whether to observe or treat these eyes is left to the judgment of the treating ophthalmologist (*I-, Moderate Quality, Strong Recommendation*). Eyes with plateau iris syndrome that experience recurrent high IOP associated with a closed angle on gonioscopy after iridotomy should undergo further therapy. Additional treatment could include iridoplasty, chronic parasympathomimetic therapy, or other surgical procedures, including cataract or clear lens extraction, although lens surgery does not guarantee that AACC will not occur. Two recent small case series studies indicate that endoscopic cycloplasty can address the ciliary process configuration and may improve IOP control in plateau iris patients. However, this procedure was combined with cataract extraction in these reports, and no studies have compared cataract extraction with and without endoscopic cycloplasty in this patient population."

            "content": "## MANAGEMENT\n### Goals\nThe goals of managing a patient with PACD are as follows:\n- Reverse or prevent the angle-closure process\n- Control IOP\n- Prevent damage to the optic nerve\n### Primary Angle-Closure Suspect\nA large population-based, randomized clinical trial in Zhongshan, China has recently shown the benefit of iridotomy for PACS, with a 50% reduction in risk for development of PAC over 6 years. However, the rarity of progression (4%) to PAC led the authors to conclude that laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) was not justified in similar populations. Observational studies suggest that the majority of patients with PACS will not develop either PAC or PACG. Yet historically, the relative safety of LPI has resulted in its wider prophylactic use for the prevention of AACC and PACG. In patients with PACS, iridotomy may be considered to reduce the risk of developing angle closure. Alternatively, patients with ITC may be followed.\nFor the development of IOP elevation, evidence of progressive narrowing, or synechial angle closure, since iridotomy can be associated, rarely, with bothersome postoperative glare and/or diplopia. Other rare complications of LPI include progression of cataract and the development of posterior synechiae.\nOther factors that may influence the decision to perform prophylactic laser iridotomy in PACS include the following:\n- Medication is required that may provoke pupillary block.\n- Symptoms are present that suggest prior intermittent AACC.\n- The patient’s health status or occupation/avocation makes it difficult to access immediate ophthalmic care (e.g., the patient resides in a nursing home facility, travels frequently to developing parts of the world, works on a merchant vessel), or if the patient is poorly compliant with follow-up.\n- There is a need for frequent dilated eye examinations (e.g., macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy evaluations).\nPatients with PACS who have not had an iridotomy should be warned that they are at risk for AACC and that certain medicines (e.g., over-the-counter decongestants, cold and flu medications, allergy medications, and sleeping aids as well as prescription psychoactive and motion-sickness medication, all of which may have anticholinergic properties) could cause pupil dilation and induce AACC. They should also be informed about the symptoms of AACC and instructed to notify their ophthalmologist immediately if symptoms occur. Some PACS patients develop increased IOP and eventually require topical ocular hypotensive agents despite LPI.\n## Primary Angle Closure and Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma\nPatients with PAC may have elevated IOP as a result of a chronic compromise of aqueous outflow due to appositional or synechial angle closure, or from damage to the trabecular meshwork after previous intermittent AACC. Although some authors advocate that iridotomy is indicated for all eyes with PAC or PACG, other reports indicate that PACG eyes with advanced optic nerve damage and extensive PAS (>180 degrees) may benefit less from LPI, particularly if lens extraction is being considered. Laser iridotomy may be performed using a thermal and/or Nd:YAG laser.\nComplications of laser iridotomy include increased IOP; laser burn to the cornea, lens, or retina; late-onset corneal edema; the development of posterior synechiae; hyphema; iritis; and the development of ocular light-induced visual disturbance. Light-induced visual disturbance may result from the prismatic effect of the tear film at the eyelid margin or from the shutter effect of the eyelid partially covering an iridotomy that is adjacent to the eyelid margin and either not fully covered by the eyelid or not fully exposed at the 3 or 9 o’clock position. Some authors have reported a reduced risk of light-induced visual disturbance with horizontal placement of the iridotomy. However, other randomized trials have shown no difference in light-induced visual disturbance symptoms between temporal and superior placement, or between superior quadrant LPI location with full, partial, or no eyelid coverage of the iridotomy.\nA recent multicenter, randomized clinical trial, Effectiveness in Angle-closure Glaucoma of Lens Extraction (EAGLE), showed that clear lens extraction provided greater IOP control and quality of life benefit for PAC patients with elevated IOP and PACG patients compared with standard care with LPI. Therefore, cataract (or clear lens) extraction could be considered for management of PAC and PACG (see section on Lens extraction for angle closure, below)."
