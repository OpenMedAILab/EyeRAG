What research has been done and what is currently known about the possible medical uses of marijuana?\\n1. What research has been done and what is currently known about the possible medical uses of marijuana?\\n2. What are the major unanswered scientific questions?\\n3. What are the diseases or conditions for which marijuana might have potential as a treatment and that merit further study?\\n4. What special issues have to be considered in conducting clinical trials of the therapeutic uses of marijuana?\\nIn 1999, the Institute of Medicine released a review of the scientific evidence to assess potential health benefits and risks of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids. Information for the study was gathered through scientific workshops, site visits to cannabis buyers’ clubs and HIV/AIDS clinics, analysis of the relevant scientific literature, and by consultation with biomedical and social scientists. This was followed by public meetings that included presentations by experts.\\nTo update this assessment, a search of the scientific literature in English was conducted in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Library for the period 1999 to 2002. The search yielded 16 citations, one of which was relevant to this assessment. In a paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Ophthalmological Society, results of a case series (n=9) of patients unresponsive to glaucoma therapy who used either inhaled marijuana or orally administered delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol capsules were presented. Although an initial decrease in IOP was observed, this decrease was not sustained. Papers presented at this meeting are not subject to the peer review process.\\nOn May 13, 2013, another search of the scientific literature was conducted in the PubMed database and the Cochrane Library for the period 2002 to 2013. The search yielded 57 citations, none of which were relevant to evaluating the effect of marijuana in the treatment of glaucoma or related conditions.\\n### Benefits\\nInitial studies in the 1970s reported that smoking marijuana resulted in lower IOP hours after administration. The NEI-sponsored studies demonstrated that some derivatives of marijuana did result in lowering of IOP when administered orally, intravenously, or by smoking, but not when topically applied to the eye. The duration of the pressure-lowering effect is reported to be in the range of 3 to 4 hours. Benefits also include euphoria as an acute effect. Also, earlier when fewer therapies were available for glaucoma, some patients might have had few acceptable or well-tolerated alternatives. There are no studies directly comparing the IOP-lowering effects of marijuana with currently available therapies.\\n### Risks\\nPotentially serious side effects associated with smoking marijuana include an increased heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure. Studies of single-administration marijuana use have shown a lowering of blood pressure concurrent with the lowering of IOP. This raises concerns that there may be compromised blood flow to the optic nerve, but no data have been published on the long-term systemic and ocular effects from the use of marijuana by patients with glaucoma.\\nOther adverse effects reported from the use of marijuana include conjunctival hyperemia, impaired immune system response, impaired memory for recent events, difficulty concentrating, impaired motor coordination, tolerance to repeated doses, decreased testosterone in men who are chronic users, and short-term withdrawal symptoms after cessation. Smoking of marijuana also can lead to emphysema-like lung changes, increased risk of cancer, and poor pregnancy outcomes. Because the duration of the induced fall in IOP is short, an individual would have to smoke a marijuana cigarette eight or ten times a day in order to control IOP over 24 hours.\\n## Questions for Scientific Inquiry\\nFor future investigation, oral or topical cannabinoids might be a more promising avenue of study, given the side effects and psychotropic effects associated with smoking of marijuana. Specific questions for this might include the following:\\n- What is the mechanism of action for lowering of IOP by oral or topical cannabinoids?\\n- Do oral or topical cannabinoids lower IOP more safely and effectively than available pharmaceutical agents?\\n- Are oral or topical cannabinoids useful in lowering IOP when combined with pharmaceutical agents or with surgery?\\n- Are oral or topical cannabinoids useful in lowering IOP in patients who are not responsive, or incompletely responsive, to standard therapies?\\n- Do oral or topical cannabinoids safely and effectively prevent progressive optic nerve damage and consequent visual field loss?\\n- What are the long-term systemic and ocular side effects associated with the use of oral or topical cannabinoids by patients with glaucoma?\", \"file_path\": \"medical_guide_markdown/Marijuana in the Treatment for Glaucoma 2014_update.md\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"content\": \"## APPENDIX 2.

However, the interpretation of results and medical and surgical management of disease require the medical training, clinical judgment, and experience of the ophthalmologist. Most diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be undertaken safely on an outpatient basis. Hospitalization may be indicated for intensive treatment of an AACC so that patients can be monitored closely after surgical procedures associated with a high risk of serious short-term postoperative complications. It may also be indicated for patients who have experienced surgical complications or for patients who have special medical or social needs.\\n## COUNSELING AND REFERRAL\\nIf the diagnosis or management of PACD is in question or is refractory to treatment, consultation with or referral to an ophthalmologist with special training or experience in managing these conditions may be indicated. Patients with substantial visual impairment or blindness may benefit from appropriate vision rehabilitation and social services. More information on vision rehabilitation, including materials for patients, is available at [www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision](www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision).\\n## SOCIOECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS\\nAt the individual patient level, research has demonstrated that glaucomatous vision loss can have a dramatic impact on a patient’s well-being. Patients with glaucoma may struggle with daily activities such as reading, walking, and driving. Performance of these activities deteriorates with worsening of glaucoma severity and when both eyes are affected. Studies have reported that patients with glaucoma are three times more likely to experience falls and six times more likely to be involved in motor vehicle collisions compared with controls. Quality of life is affected for patients with all stages of glaucoma, even those with early disease.\\nThe costs of managing a chronic disease like glaucoma can be broken down into direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs. Direct costs include costs of visits to eye care providers, ancillary testing, and medical and surgical interventions. One study estimated that nearly $3 billion USD per year is spent on the direct medical costs for all forms of glaucoma. Direct nonmedical\\n## Economic Burden of Glaucoma\\nCosts (e.g., costs for transportation to appointments and nursing home care) and indirect costs (e.g., loss of productivity of the patient or caregivers) can be more difficult to quantify but are substantial. Using California Medicare claims data and Markov modeling, one study estimated that the average direct and indirect medical costs for patients with glaucoma are $1688 higher over a lifetime than for other patients without this condition.²¹¹\\nCosts of glaucoma are impacted by disease severity and type of glaucoma. One study determined the average annual direct medical costs for patients with early glaucoma, advanced glaucoma, and end-stage glaucoma were $623, $1915, and $2511, respectively.²¹² Among patients with early glaucoma, most of the costs of care are for medications.²¹³ For those with advanced disease, indirect costs such as costs for home health care and rehabilitation predominate.²¹⁴ ²¹⁵ A study of enrollees in Medicare using 2009 claims data compared mean payments per beneficiary for those with open-angle glaucoma versus angle-closure glaucoma. The study found the mean payment for angle-closure glaucoma beneficiaries was significantly higher ($303 compared with $263 USD). The higher costs in the study were driven by mean greater use of laser surgery in the angle-closure beneficiary group.²¹⁶\\nWhen considering the economic burden of glaucoma, it is important to appreciate that glaucoma affects a disproportionately large number of racial minorities. In fact, glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness among African Americans, and studies have demonstrated greater risk of glaucoma among Latinos and Asian Americans relative to non-Hispanic whites as well. Various studies have noted disparities in utilization of eye care services among racial minorities. Studies have demonstrated that African Americans are somewhat less likely to undergo examinations for glaucoma relative to whites,²¹⁷ ²¹⁸ have lower rates of undergoing visual field testing relative to whites in the year before glaucoma surgery,²¹⁹ and have lower rates of using of medical and surgical interventions for glaucoma.²²⁰ A more recent study found that despite possessing health insurance, Latinos were significantly less likely to undergo monitoring for glaucoma relative to whites.²²¹ In the care of patients with glaucoma and at risk for glaucoma, it will be important to ensure that racial minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients have adequate access to eye care services and receive care that is in line with recommended clinical practice guidelines.\", \"file_path\": \"medical_guide_markdown/Primary Angle-Closure Disease PPP.md\"}]\n```\n\n",
