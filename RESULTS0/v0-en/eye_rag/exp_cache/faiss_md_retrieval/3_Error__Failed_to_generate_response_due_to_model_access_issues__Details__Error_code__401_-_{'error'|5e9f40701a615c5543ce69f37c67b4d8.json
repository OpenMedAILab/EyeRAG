            "content": "## Information Statement\n### Innovative Technologies in Diagnosing Eye Diseases and Conditions\n### Introduction\nNew innovative diagnostic technologies have proliferated in the past several years, based on wide availability of smartphones, other devices, and the Internet. These technologies provide the means for patients to measure their own visual acuity and refractive error, and for physicians or other health care providers to take images of the eye, without requiring expensive equipment. The potential of these technologies could be positive in enhancing patient understanding and management of their condition, making diagnostic tools available in more remote settings, permitting remote diagnosis and interpretation, and reducing health care visits and costs.\n### Background\nThe Academy’s [Code of Ethics](https://www.aao.org/clinical-education/code-of-ethics) provides broad principles for the use of these innovative technologies. The Code of Ethics states that it is the responsibility of an ophthalmologist to act in the best interest of the patient. In addition, the honored ideals of the medical profession imply that the responsibility of the ophthalmologist extends not only to the individual but also to society as a whole. Activities that have the purpose of improving the health and well-being of the patient and/or the community in a cost-effective way deserve the interest, support, and participation of the ophthalmologist.\n### Recommendations\nThe Academy recognizes the potential of information technology, including Internet-based screening, refraction, and other diagnostic tests, in increasing access to health care services, enhancing patient involvement in their health care decision making, improving efficiency, and reducing overall health care costs. The Academy recommends that ophthalmologists evaluate these technologies as they would any other diagnostic modalities: FDA approval (if required), evidence of reliability and reproducibility from clinical trials or studies, evaluation of risk to the patient, (for example, situations that pose low risk to patients would be refractive assessments), and provisions for security of protected health information (PHI). As with any other device or technology selected for use in the patient’s care, the ophthalmologist would potentially bear the risk of medicolegal liability of any harm to the patient, for a missed diagnosis, or a breach of PHI.\n### Approvals\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology, Health Policy Committee\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology, Quality of Care Secretary\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology, Board of Trustees, October 2014\n©2014 American Academy of Ophthalmology\nP.O.

            "content": "## Minimizing Medication Errors: Communication about Drug Orders - 2015\n### Medication Errors: Definition of the Problem\nMedication errors are defined as \"any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient or consumer. Such events may be related to professional practice, health care products, procedures and systems, including prescribing, order communication, product labeling, packaging and nomenclature, compounding, dispensing, distribution, administration, education, monitoring and use,\" by the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP). Information about medication errors is collected through reports to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), direct contact reports (MedWatch) or reports from the US Pharmacopeia (USP) or Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP).\nMedication errors are a common cause of malpractice claims against physicians. The Physician Insurers Association of America (PIAA) reviewed data on 117,000 claims and lawsuits and found that medication errors were the second most common cause for claims. In this review of 700 medicolegal cases in ophthalmology, medication errors were found to be the third most frequent complaint. Although medication errors constituted only 2% of the claims for the Ophthalmic Mutual Insurance Company (OMIC) insureds, these claims have been more costly than the average case and more likely to result in indemnity payments. A 2005 study of prescription errors at an ophthalmic hospital showed that 8% of prescription sheets had errors.\nThere is a significant potential for error because of the high volume of medications prescribed and dispensed. “Adverse drug events are among the most common causes of health care related harm, affecting approximately two million hospital stays and accounting for an estimated 3.5 million physician office visits and one million emergency department visits per year, according to the National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Event Prevention,” the USP said in a statement. “Additionally, at least 20% of all harm to hospitalized patients is associated with medications.”\nIn 1995, it was estimated that ophthalmologists prescribed medications at 52.4% of all patient visits in the office (21,340,000 visits from a total of 40,714,000 visits), according to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Of all patient visits, 23.8% of the visits involved 1 medication, 15.1% of the visits involved 2 medications, and 13.5% of the visits involved more than 2 medications. A total of 42,098,276 or over 40 million medications were prescribed or provided in 1995 in ophthalmologists' offices.\n### Contributing Factors to the Problem\nThe American Hospital Association lists these common factors that contribute to medication errors:"

            "content": "## Conclusions\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology concludes that the risk of re-identification with de-identified retinal images is low, based on principles guiding expert determinations of de-identified information under the HIPAA privacy rule. The real benefits to advancing scientific knowledge and innovation, addressing eye disease and treatment for individual patients, and accelerating approaches to address public health issues to improve population vision health warrant the collection and collation of retinal images for research and quality improvement purposes. To reduce risks of re-identification further, the Academy promotes the alignment of data use agreements that prohibit any unapproved uses of de-identified retinal imaging data, including any attempts to re-identify patients. The American Academy of Ophthalmology proposes that the federal government, state legislatures, research agencies, and other entities do not include retinal images as a biometric identifier based on this assessment of risks of re-identification as very small. Instead, the American Academy of Ophthalmology supports the promotion of data use agreements to restrict access and to safeguard retinal images from improper use. In this way, well-intentioned efforts to protect patient privacy can focus on biometrics like iris image analysis that carry a real risk of re-identification through commercially available scanners and databases. Otherwise, unnecessary and unwarranted labeling of retinal scans as biometric identifiers could stifle research based on sharing and collaboration of retinal images, thus slowing advances in the prevention and treatment of vision loss and disability for the millions of Americans with retinal disease. In summary, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends the following for appropriate aggregation and use of retinal images for research and use in training artificial intelligence for clinical applications:\n1. Images do not include any patient name or identifying information.\n2. No readily available data source exists that could link patient identifying information with an image.\n3. Data use agreements specify a ban on any re-identification activities.\nApproved by the American Academy of Ophthalmology Board of Trustees, June 22, 2024.\n## Footnotes and Disclosures\nOriginally received: June 22, 2024.\nFinal revision: July 15, 2024.\nAccepted: July 29, 2024.\nAvailable online: .
