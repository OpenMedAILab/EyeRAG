            "content": "## HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARE\nSymptomatic cataract is a surgical disorder. Dietary intake and nutritional supplements have demonstrated minimal effect on the prevention or treatment of cataract.\nMost cataract surgery in the United States is performed by small-incision phacoemulsification with foldable intraocular lens (IOL) implantation on an outpatient basis.\nRefractive cataract surgery, including astigmatism management, intraoperative refractive guidance, and specialty IOL implantation, has the potential to reduce a patient’s dependence on eyeglasses or contact lenses for distance, intermediate, and near vision.\nFemtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) increases the circularity and centration of the capsulorrhexis and the precision of the corneal incisions. It may also reduce the amount of ultrasonic energy required to remove a cataract. However, the technology is not yet cost-effective, and the overall risk profile and refractive outcomes have not been shown to be superior to that of standard phacoemulsification.\nTopical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce the incidence of early postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME), but a long-term benefit has not been demonstrated.\nThere is substantial evidence that intracameral antibiotic administration reduces the risk of postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis. Increasing evidence also suggests that topically applied antibiotics do not add to the benefit of intracameral injection.\nMinimally invasive glaucoma surgery can enhance the intraocular pressure-lowering effects of cataract surgery in some patients with mild to moderate glaucoma.\n## INTRODUCTION\n### DISEASE DEFINITION\nA cataract is a degradation of the optical quality of the crystalline lens that affects vision. Most cataract development is related to aging, and it can occur in one or both eyes.\n### PATIENT POPULATION\nAdults (18 years old and older) with cataracts.\n### CLINICAL OBJECTIVES\n- Identify the presence and characteristics of a cataract.\n- Assess the impact of cataract on a patient’s visual status and function as well as the effect on quality of life.\n- Educate the patient about the natural history of cataract and its impact on vision and functional activity. Explain the benefits and risks of surgery and other treatment alternatives to enable the patient to make an informed decision about treatment options.\n- Explain advantages and disadvantages of intraocular lens (IOL) options, including astigmatic, multifocal, extended depth of focus, accommodating, postoperatively power adjustable, and monovision IOL alternatives, to reduce the patient’s need for spectacles or contact lenses after surgery.\n- Identify any ocular comorbidities, high-risk ocular features, or systemic issues that could impact the performance and outcomes of surgery.\n- Establish criteria for a successful treatment outcome with the patient, including working distance(s) and potential limitations in visual outcome(s).\n- Discuss potential postoperative refractive options, including bilateral emmetropia, bilateral myopia, and monovision, as well as the management of any anisometropia between surgical procedures.\n- Perform cataract surgery when surgery will result in enhanced patient function and when the informed patient elects this option. Timing of surgery should be based on what is mutually agreeable between the patient and surgeon.\n- Perform surgery when indicated for improved visualization and management of coexisting ocular disease, such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy.\n- Provide appropriate postoperative care, visual rehabilitation, and treatment of any complications, such as elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or corneal edema.\n- Improve patient safety by reducing the risk of traffic accidents, falls, and fractures.\n## BACKGROUND\n### PREVALENCE\nCataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. The risk of cataract increases with each decade of life starting around age 40. Cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment among Americans of all studied ethnic and racial backgrounds. In the United States, the number of people with cataract is forecasted to double from 24.4 million to about 50 million by the year 2050.\nThere are several different types of cataracts that can be categorized according to which part of the lens becomes opaque. Each type has its own anatomical location, pathology, and risks for development. The different types can exist separately or in various combinations. Several systems are available to classify and grade lens opacities, but variations in grading systems make it difficult to compare prevalence rates between studies."

            "content": "## NATURAL HISTORY\nCataract typically progresses over time, although the type, severity, and rate of progression vary considerably among patients. With age, the lens increases in thickness and weight. Once visual acuity and function decline, the disease progresses with no chance of reversal. Three large studies demonstrate that PSCs progress more quickly than nuclear and cortical cataracts.²³, ¹⁰³⁻¹⁰⁵\n## VISUAL FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE\nThe multiple components of visual function include near, intermediate, and distance visual acuity; peripheral vision; visual search; binocular vision; depth perception; contrast sensitivity; color perception; dark adaptation; and visual processing speed.¹⁰⁶ Visual function can also be measured in terms of patient-reported disability caused by visual impairment.¹⁰⁷⁻¹¹¹ Many activities of daily living require adequate function of more than one of these visual components.\nThe treatment outcomes that are the most crucial and relevant to the patient are improved visual function and quality of life. Well-designed studies consistently show that cataract surgery has a substantial positive impact on vision-dependent functioning. Up to 90% of patients undergoing first-eye cataract surgery note improvement in functional status and satisfaction with vision.¹¹²⁻¹¹⁶ Several studies report an association between improved visual function and an improved health-related quality of life.¹⁰⁹, ¹¹⁷⁻¹²⁰ Visual function plays an important role in physical performance and well-being,¹²¹⁻¹²³ particularly with regard to mobility.¹¹⁷, ¹²⁴ Loss of vision in the elderly is associated with a decline in physical and mental function as well as loss of independence in the activities of daily living.¹²⁵ Examples include daytime and nighttime driving as well as community and home activities. A 10-year evaluation of patients in the Blue Mountains Eye Study found that those who underwent cataract surgery experienced a significant improvement in mental health domain scores on the SF-36 questionnaire.¹²⁶ Cataract surgery may also help alleviate insomnia.¹²⁷, ¹²⁸ The very elderly (80+ to 85+ years, depending on the study) also benefit from cataract surgery, with benefits outweighing the risks."

            "content": "## CARE PROCESS\n### PATIENT OUTCOME CRITERIA\nOutcome criteria can vary for each patient, depending on the patient’s needs, lifestyle, and medical condition. In general, outcome criteria include the following:\n- Reduction of visual symptoms\n- Improvement in visual function\n- Achievement of desired refractive outcome, including desired working distance(s)\n- Improvement in physical function, mental health, and quality of life\n### DIAGNOSIS\nThe purpose of the comprehensive evaluation of a patient whose chief complaint might be related to cataract development is to identify the presence of a cataract, confirm that a cataract is a significant factor contributing to the visual impairment and symptoms described by the patient, and identify other ocular or systemic conditions that might be contributing to visual impairment.\n#### Evaluation of Visual Impairment\nThe impact of cataract on visual function can be subjectively assessed by self-reported functional status or difficulty with vision.\nPatients may adapt to their visual impairment over time, however, and may fail to notice functional decline that accompanies the insidious progression of typical cataract. Visual function may be assessed using tests that measure contrast sensitivity, glare disability, or visual acuity at near and distance. It is also possible to objectively measure the higher-order aberrations from cataract that may compromise visual acuity and quality.\nThere is no single test or measure that adequately describes the effect of a cataract on a patient’s visual status or functional ability. Similarly, no single test can properly define a threshold for performing cataract surgery. The Snellen visual acuity chart is an excellent tool for testing distance visual acuity in healthy eyes, and it is widely used clinically. Poor preoperative visual acuity correlates with greater postoperative functional improvement in many patients with cataract. Testing only at distance with high-contrast letters that are viewed in low-ambient lighting conditions underestimates the functional problems that are experienced by patients in common, real-life situations. Other important indicators of vision impairment may include daytime or nighttime glare, halos and starbursts at night (especially while driving), reduced reading speed, and impaired optical quality causing monocular diplopia or ghosting.\nCataract development makes it difficult for patients to perform basic activities of daily living such as eating and dressing, shopping, personal finances, medication management, and driving. Because preoperative distance visual acuity alone may be an unreliable predictor of postoperative functional improvement, the decision to recommend cataract surgery should not be made solely on the basis of Snellen visual acuity.\nStudies have indicated that measures of functional visual impairment provide valid and reliable information that is not reflected in the measurement of visual acuity alone.\nSeveral patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been developed. Two main categories of validated questionnaires for measuring function exist; those that measure general health status (e.g., Short Form-36, Quality of Well-Being Scale) and vision-specific measures. Questionnaires that measure general health status provide findings that are less strongly correlated with improvement following cataract surgery than vision-specific measures. Examples of vision-specific instruments developed or used for cataract evaluation include the Visual Activities Questionnaire, the Activities of Daily Vision Scale (ADVS), the Visual Function-14 (VF-14) and modified versions (e.g., VF-8R), the National Eye Institute-Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ), and the Catquest-9SF.\n## Ophthalmic Evaluation\nA comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation, or history and physical examination, includes those components of the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation specifically relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of a cataract as listed below.\n- Patient history, including an assessment of functional status, pertinent medical conditions, medications currently used, and other risk factors that can affect the surgical plan or outcome of surgery (e.g., immunosuppressive conditions, use of systemic alpha-1 antagonists, diabetes)\n- Visual acuity with correction (the power of the present correction recorded) at distance and, when appropriate, at near\n- Refraction and measurement of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) in both eyes\n- Glare testing when indicated\n- Assessment of pupil size and function\n- Visual field assessment\n- Examination of ocular alignment and motility\n- External examination (eyelids, lashes, lacrimal apparatus, orbit)\n- Measurement of IOP\n- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens, vitreous, macula, peripheral retina, and optic nerve through a dilated pupil\n- Indirect ophthalmoscopy"

    "query": "Based on your clinical data, I can provide you with specific information about your left eye age-related cataract and the likelihood of requiring surgery in the future.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nYes, your left eye age-related cataract will likely require surgical intervention in the future. Your clinical examination shows that you have significant lens turbidity (clouding) in your left eye, which is characteristic of senile cataract. This condition typically progresses over time and eventually requires surgical treatment to restore vision.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYour current admission diagnosis includes \"Left eye senile cataract\" as one of the two main conditions. The specialty examination findings specifically note that your left eye has \"lens turbid\" (cloudy lens), which confirms the presence of cataract. This is in addition to your primary diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma, which was the immediate concern requiring your recent hospitalization.\n\n**Educational Information:**\nA cataract is a clouding of the natural lens inside your eye. As a senile (age-related) cataract progresses, it typically causes:\n- Gradual blurring of vision\n- Increased difficulty with daily activities like reading or driving\n- Potential for glare and halos around lights\n- Colors may appear faded or yellowed\n\nThe natural progression of age-related cataracts means they generally worsen over time. While the timing varies for each individual, surgical removal of the cloudy lens and replacement with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) is the standard treatment when the cataract significantly affects your vision and quality of life.\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps:**\n1. **Immediate Priority:** Your current focus should be on managing your acute angle-closure glaucoma, which was the reason for your recent hospitalization. This condition requires careful monitoring and treatment to prevent permanent vision loss.\n\n2. **Cataract Monitoring:** Once your glaucoma is stabilized, your ophthalmologist will monitor the progression of your cataract during regular follow-up visits.\n\n3. **Surgical Timing:** Cataract surgery is typically recommended when the clouding significantly interferes with your daily activities and quality of life. Your ophthalmologist will help determine the optimal timing based on:\n   - How much the cataract affects your vision\n   - Your ability to perform daily tasks\n   - The stability of your glaucoma condition\n   - Your overall eye health\n\n4. **Combined Procedures:** In some cases, cataract surgery can be combined with glaucoma procedures, which your ophthalmologist may discuss with you when appropriate.\n\nIt's important to maintain regular follow-up appointments with your ophthalmologist to monitor both your glaucoma and cataract progression. They will guide you on the best timing for cataract surgery based on your specific visual needs and overall eye health.",
