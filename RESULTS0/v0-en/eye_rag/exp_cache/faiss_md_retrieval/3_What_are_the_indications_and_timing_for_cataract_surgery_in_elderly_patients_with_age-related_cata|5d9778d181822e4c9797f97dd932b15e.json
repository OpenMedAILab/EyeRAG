            "content": "## Surgical Management\nThe predominant method of cataract surgery in much of the world is sutureless, small-incision phacoemulsification with foldable IOL implantation performed on an outpatient basis. Sutures or sealants are used for incision closure if needed. In randomized clinical trials, phacoemulsification produces better uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and a lower rate of surgical complications, such as iris prolapse and posterior capsule rupture, than manual extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with incision closure by sutures or manual small-incision cataract extraction (MSICS). Phacoemulsification limits the astigmatic changes that occur with larger incisions and enables both astigmatism management and the implantation of specialty IOLs.\nIn economically disadvantaged countries, MSICS remains popular because of its cost-effectiveness, and sutureless ECCE with IOL implantation performed very well compared with phacoemulsification in one randomized clinical trial.\n### Indications for Surgery\nThe primary indication for cataract surgery is a decline in visual function such that it no longer meets a patient’s visual needs and for which surgery provides a reasonable likelihood of improvement. Other indications for cataract removal include the following:\n- There is clinically significant anisometropia in the presence of a cataract.\n- A lens opacity interferes with optimal diagnosis or management of posterior segment pathology.\n- A lens causes inflammation and related secondary glaucoma (phacolytic, lens particle, phacoantigenic).\n- The lens induces primary angle closure or other forms of lens-related glaucoma.\n### Contraindications to Surgery\nSurgery for a cataract should not be performed under the following circumstances:\n## Preoperative Evaluation and Counseling\nThe ophthalmologist who will perform cataract surgery should do the following:\n- Examine the patient preoperatively (see Ophthalmic Evaluation section).\n- Ensure that the documented evaluation accurately reflects the symptoms, findings, and indications for treatment.\n- Obtain informed consent from the patient or the patient’s surrogate decision maker after discussing the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery, including the patient’s expected surgical experience and the anticipated refractive outcome.\n- Review the results of the presurgical evaluation with the patient or the patient’s surrogate decision maker.\n- Counsel the patient about postoperative refractive options, such as bilateral emmetropia, bilateral myopia, or monovision, that will work best given the ophthalmic history and patient’s desires.\n- Counsel the patient about elective refractive options, such as astigmatism management, intraoperative refractive guidance, specialty IOLs (toric, extended depth of focus, multifocal, accommodating, and postoperative power adjustable), and postoperative refractive enhancement.\n- Consider the effect of ocular comorbidities in the cataract care process.\n- Formulate a plan, including preoperative medical management, selection of appropriate anesthesia, surgical approach, concurrent procedures, and IOL design and power.\n- Assess relevant aspects of the patient’s mental and physical status, such as the ability to cooperate and position for surgery.\n- Formulate a postoperative care plan and inform the patient or the patient’s surrogate decision maker of these arrangements (setting of care, care provider).\n- Determine the effect of any concurrent upper-eyelid blepharoptosis. Blepharoptosis can induce corneal astigmatism or make astigmatism more difficult to measure. Additionally, cataract surgery can worsen blepharoptosis.\n- Answer the patient’s questions about the surgery and care, including associated costs.\n- Assess barriers to communication, including language or hearing impairment.\n- Ensure that the patient and the patient’s caregiver, if applicable, are committed and able to attend the postoperative visits and address transportation, medication administration, and other potential challenges.\nIdeally, the operating ophthalmologist should perform the preoperative assessment because this allows the surgeon to formulate a plan and establish a relationship with the patient before surgery. Although the ophthalmologist is responsible for the examination and review of the data, certain aspects of data collection may be conducted by other trained team members under the ophthalmologist’s supervision and within his or her review.\nPatients undergoing cataract surgery frequently have a preoperative medical evaluation, including a history and physical examination that takes into consideration the risk factors for undergoing the planned anesthesia. However, three randomized clinical trials have failed to show that this evaluation reduces systemic or ocular complications and no trials have shown it to be efficacious. For patients with certain severe systemic diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, poorly controlled arterial blood pressure, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, poorly controlled congestive heart failure, or poorly controlled diabetes), additional evaluation and management may be indicated."

            "content": "## Fellow-eye management\nThe fellow eye of a patient with AACC should be evaluated, because it is at high risk for a similar event. The fellow eye should be scheduled for a prophylactic LPI promptly if the chamber angle is anatomically narrow, since approximately half of fellow eyes of acute angle-closure patients can develop AACCs within 5 years. These attacks can occur within days of presentation and, therefore, an ophthalmologist should consider LPI in the fellow eye as soon as possible. Chronic parasympathomimetic therapy is not an appropriate alternative, either for prophylaxis of the fellow eye or for treatment of established angle closure, and it is not a substitute for iridotomy. About 40% of fellow eyes treated with parasympathomimetics can develop an AACC within 5 years, and many eyes with PACD can develop progressive formation of synechial angle closure with miotic use. Prophylactic LPIs are effective in preventing AACC in the fellow eye, although one study found that 53% of fellow eyes developed PACG after almost 6 years of follow-up, even after prophylactic LPI was performed.\n## Lens extraction for angle closure\nNumerous studies document that lens extraction significantly widens the anterior chamber angle in eyes that have PACD. In prospective and retrospective studies, cataract surgery also has been shown to lower postoperative medication requirements and decrease complications compared with iridectomy, iridotomy, or trabeculectomy for PACG and AACC. Although lens extraction with or without goniosynechialysis can substantially lower IOP, it has been documented that cataract extraction alone does not result in as low an IOP as cataract surgery combined with trabeculectomy. The risks and benefits of different procedures in eyes with angle closure should be considered when determining the most appropriate surgery.\nIn patients with AACC, phacoemulsification performed soon after initial medical reduction of IOP is effective in maintaining IOP control and reducing the need for glaucoma medications. However, cataract surgery in AACC eyes may have greater risk of operative complications due to the small dimensions of the anterior chamber and the tendency for choroidal expansion.\nThe EAGLE Study has recently shown the effectiveness of clear lens extraction with intraocular lens implantation for the treatment of PAC with elevated IOP (≥30 mm Hg at diagnosis) and PACG. This study found clear lens extraction to be superior to LPI for IOP control in PAC with elevated IOP and PACG; in addition, patients had better quality of life scores. Treatment with phacoemulsification was estimated to be cost-effective at 3 years and cost saving by 10 years in the United Kingdom.\n## Plateau Iris Configuration and Syndrome\nThe success of prophylactic laser iridoplasty after laser iridotomy to prevent PACG and AACC in eyes with plateau iris has been reported in a case series. However, a 2012 Cochrane review found no randomized controlled trials to provide evidence to support the use of this procedure in these eyes. Given the lack of convincing evidence in the literature for prophylactic use of iridoplasty in these patients, and since iridoplasty can be painful for the patient and may cause inflammation, the decision of whether to observe or treat these eyes is left to the judgment of the treating ophthalmologist (*I-, Moderate Quality, Strong Recommendation*). Eyes with plateau iris syndrome that experience recurrent high IOP associated with a closed angle on gonioscopy after iridotomy should undergo further therapy. Additional treatment could include iridoplasty, chronic parasympathomimetic therapy, or other surgical procedures, including cataract or clear lens extraction, although lens surgery does not guarantee that AACC will not occur. Two recent small case series studies indicate that endoscopic cycloplasty can address the ciliary process configuration and may improve IOP control in plateau iris patients. However, this procedure was combined with cataract extraction in these reports, and no studies have compared cataract extraction with and without endoscopic cycloplasty in this patient population."

            "content": "## Cataract Surgery with Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery\nA variety of minimally invasive techniques are available that can be performed in conjunction with or following cataract surgery. These include:\n- Ab interno canaloplasty\n- Ab interno trabeculotomy\n- Endocyclophotocoagulation\nSeveral generations of ab interno trabecular bypass microstents are available, any of which can be performed or implanted at the time of cataract surgery.\nCompared with traditional filtering surgery with antimetabolite usage, these adjunctive technologies may reduce the risk of hypotony and bleb complications, but they may not lower IOP as effectively. A multicenter, randomized, single-masked, controlled clinical trial showed that:\n- IOP was clinically lower at 2 years in the trabecular bypass microstent plus cataract surgery group compared with the cataract surgery-alone group, with no differences in safety.\nThe best surgical option depends on a number of factors, including:\n- The patient’s response to medical or laser surgical treatment of the glaucoma\n- The degree of optic nerve damage\n- Changes in the visual field\n- Severity of the cataract\n- The surgeon’s experience.\nA thorough discussion of the MIGS devices can be found in the **Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG) PPP**.\n## Cataract Surgery and Corneal Disease\n### Combined Cataract and Endothelial Transplant Surgery\nCataract surgery in patients with coexistent endothelial dystrophy should be approached with:\n- Careful patient consent\n- Attention to which patients are most at risk of rapid progression.\nThe presence of endothelial dystrophy presents a challenge to the cataract surgeon in predicting how well the compromised cornea will function following cataract surgery. Often the best strategy is to simply perform cataract surgery with proper consent regarding the possibility of subsequent corneal failure.\nThis approach is becoming more common as:\n- Cataract surgery has become gentler\n- Endothelial keratoplasty has become more elegant.\nDispersive OVD can be used to coat the endothelium and minimize ultrasound energy, potentially delaying or eliminating the need for subsequent keratoplasty in some cases. However, it is not clear if FLACS reduces the risk of subsequent endothelial failure because of conflicting studies.\n#### Clinical Significance\n- A history of blurred vision upon awakening in the morning may indicate endothelial pump impairment.\n- If the lack of tear evaporation while sleeping leads to symptomatic corneal edema, there is a likelihood of decompensation after cataract surgery.\nPatients with Fuchs dystrophy who have:\n- A history of morning decline in vision\n- No visible epithelial or stromal edema on slit lamp examination\nare more likely to progress rapidly after cataract surgery, and surgeons should consider concurrent endothelial transplant surgery.\nEndothelial keratoplasty can create a hyperopic shift that may complicate combined surgery, as described earlier in the **Ocular Comorbidities** section.\n### Combined Cataract Surgery and Penetrating Keratoplasty\nThere are several reasons to consider combining cataract extraction with corneal transplantation, even in the presence of a mild cataract:\n- Cataracts may progress more rapidly after corneal transplantation."
