    "response": "Based on your recent diagnosis of left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and left eye senile cataract, and the symptoms you experienced such as sudden distending pain, blurred vision, eye redness, photophobia, tearing, headache, and nausea, it's important to understand that lifestyle changes primarily focus on managing your overall health and supporting your eye health, rather than directly preventing the acute angle-closure glaucoma itself, which is often related to the anatomy of your eye.\n\nWhile your clinical data doesn't specify particular lifestyle changes to prevent future acute angle-closure glaucoma attacks, it's generally recommended to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This includes managing any underlying health conditions you may have, even though your history indicates you deny chronic diseases like diabetes or coronary heart disease. Regular follow-up with your ophthalmologist is crucial to monitor your intraocular pressure and the condition of your eyes, especially given your history of senile cataract in the left eye and the acute glaucoma episode. Adhering to any prescribed medications or treatments will be key in preventing further damage. It's also advisable to avoid situations that might trigger an acute attack, such as prolonged periods in dim lighting or taking certain medications that can dilate pupils, if your doctor has advised against them. Always discuss any concerns or potential triggers with your ophthalmologist.",

        "ClinicalHistory": "Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in the left eye for 4 days.\nHistory of Present Illness: Four days ago, the patient experienced sudden onset of distending pain in the left eye without obvious precipitating factors, accompanied by a rapid decrease in vision. Both distant and near vision were unclear, accompanied by irritative symptoms such as eye redness, photophobia, and tearing, as well as ipsilateral headache and nausea. Denies history of ocular trauma. As symptoms persisted without relief, the patient came to our hospital today for treatment. After relevant examinations in the outpatient clinic, the patient was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of \"1. Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma; 2. Bilateral pseudophakia.\" During the course of the illness, there was no fever or cough. Appetite and sleep were poor, but bowel movements and urination were normal.\nPast Medical History and Surgical/Trauma History: General condition: Usually in general good health. Denies history of chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease; denies history of blood transfusion or trauma. Denies history of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, bacillary dysentery, and typhoid fever. Immunizations completed on schedule. Denies allergies to sulfonamide drugs, streptomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, cephalosporins, other medications, or any known food allergies.\nOphthalmic Examination: Vod 0.4, Vos 0.1. IOP OD Tn, OS T+2. Right eye: conjunctiva without hyperemia, cornea clear, peripheral anterior chamber shallow, aqueous humor clear, pupil round with a diameter of approximately 3mm, reactive to light (+), lens turbid, fundus visible with retina attached, no obvious hemorrhage or exudation seen. Left eye: conjunctival mixed hyperemia (++), corneal opacity and edema, subepithelial bullae, KP (-), anterior chamber shallow, peripheral anterior chamber <1/3 CT, aqueous flare (+), pupil round with a diameter of approximately 4mm, reactive to light (+), lens turbid, fundus not visible.",
        "DifferentialDiagnosis": "1. Acute iridocyclitis: Sudden onset of eye redness, eye pain, varying degrees of vision loss, intraocular pressure usually not elevated, significant anterior chamber inflammatory reaction, pupil constricted and irregular in shape.\n2. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis: Patients are mostly young and middle-aged adults, acute sharp increase in intraocular pressure, local irritation symptoms are mild, anterior chamber is not shallow, open angle, mutton-fat KPs on the posterior cornea."
