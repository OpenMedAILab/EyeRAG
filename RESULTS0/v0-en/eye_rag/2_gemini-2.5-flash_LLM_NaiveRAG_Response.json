    "response": "Based on your recent admission for left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and senile cataract, you experienced a sudden onset of severe eye pain, blurred vision, redness, photophobia, tearing, headache, and nausea. These are classic symptoms of an acute angle-closure crisis (AACC), which is a severe form of primary angle-closure disease (PACD).\n\nRegarding lifestyle changes to prevent further damage to your eyes, the provided medical literature primarily focuses on medical and surgical treatments for glaucoma rather than specific lifestyle modifications. However, it does mention that higher intensity exercise may reduce the risk of developing glaucoma. While this finding is related to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and your diagnosis is primary acute angle-closure glaucoma, maintaining a healthy lifestyle that includes physical activity is generally beneficial for overall health.\n\nIt's important to understand that your condition, primary acute angle-closure glaucoma, is characterized by a narrow angle in your eye, which can lead to a sudden increase in eye pressure. Risk factors for PACD include older age, female gender, and a thick and anteriorly positioned crystalline lens, all of which are relevant to your clinical picture. The immediate treatment for an acute angle-closure crisis involves medications to lower eye pressure, followed by laser iridotomy or iridectomy. Lens extraction (cataract surgery) is also an effective treatment for some patients with PAC and PACG, and you have a senile cataract in your left eye.\n\nWhile specific lifestyle changes beyond general health recommendations are not extensively detailed in the provided literature for preventing further damage from acute angle-closure glaucoma, it is crucial to adhere to your ophthalmologist's treatment plan, including any prescribed medications and recommended procedures. Regular follow-up evaluations are essential to monitor your eye pressure, visual field, and optic nerve health to ensure the stability of your condition and prevent progression.",

            "content": "## HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARE\nUnderstanding the current disease definition is important in the management of the primary angle-closure disease (PACD) spectrum. Modern classification includes:\n- Primary angle-closure suspect (PACS): ≥180 degrees iridotrabecular contact (ITC), normal intraocular pressure (IOP), and no optic nerve damage\n- Primary angle closure (PAC): ≥180 degrees ITC with peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) or elevated IOP but no optic neuropathy\n- Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG): ≥180 degrees ITC with PAS, elevated IOP, and optic neuropathy\n- Acute angle-closure crisis (AACC): occluded angle with symptomatic high IOP\n- Plateau iris configuration: narrow angle due to an anteriorly positioned ciliary body, with deep central anterior chamber\n- Plateau iris syndrome: narrow angle due to an anteriorly positioned ciliary body, with deep central anterior chamber, and any ITC persisting after patent peripheral iridotomy\nCommon risk factors for PACD include Asian descent, hyperopia, older age, female gender, short axial length, and thick and anteriorly positioned crystalline lens.\nDark-room dynamic gonioscopy should be performed to diagnose PACD and to verify improvement in angle configuration following treatment. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) can also aid in the diagnosis of angle closure, but only UBM and dynamic gonioscopy can identify the etiology of plateau iris.\nThe clinical signs and symptoms of AACC include pressure-induced corneal edema (experienced as blurred vision and occasionally as halos around lights), a mid-dilated pupil, vascular congestion (i.e., conjunctival and episcleral), eye pain, headache, and nausea/vomiting.\nPatients experiencing AACC should receive medical treatment, including aqueous suppressants, parasympathomimetics, and osmotic agents, if necessary, to lower the IOP acutely and relieve symptoms. This should be followed by laser iridotomy or iridectomy. After addressing the episode of AACC, it is important to perform laser iridotomy in the fellow eye when indicated.\nLens extraction is an effective treatment for some patients with PAC and PACG."

            "content": "## Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Preferred Practice Pattern\n### Background:\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic, progressive ocular disease causing loss of the optic nerve rim and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) with associated visual field defects. The anterior chamber angle is open, and the disease is generally bilateral. Risk factors for POAG include older age, African race or Latino/Hispanic ethnicity, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), family history of glaucoma, lower ocular perfusion pressure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thin central cornea. It is estimated that 53 million people in the world have POAG in 2020 with a prevalence of 3.0% in the population aged 40 to 80 years.\n### Rationale for Treatment:\nClinical trials have shown that lowering IOP reduces the risk of developing POAG and slows the progression of the disease. Medical, laser, and incisional surgical approaches exist to effectively lower IOP. Early diagnosis and treatment generally prevent visual disability.\n### Care Process:\nThe goals of managing patients with POAG are to control IOP in a target range and to prevent progressive visual field and optic nerve/RNFL damage in order to preserve visual function and quality of life. The initial glaucoma evaluation includes all components of the comprehensive adult medical evaluation focusing on those elements that specifically pertain to the diagnosis and management of POAG. Important diagnostic testing includes central corneal thickness measurement, visual field evaluation, and imaging of the optic nerve head, RNFL and macula. The relative risks and benefits of treatment with medications, laser therapy, or incisional surgery should be discussed with the patient prior to its initiation. The adequacy of treatment is determined during follow-up by regular assessment of the optic nerve appearance and quantitative evaluation with visual field testing and imaging of the optic nerve head, RNFL and macula."

            "content": "## Endoscopic Cyclophotocoagulation\nEndoscopic cyclophotocoagulation<sup>633, 634, 637</sup> may be combined with cataract surgery. One randomized trial comparing cataract surgery combined with either ECP or trabeculectomy suggested that IOP lowering efficacy is similar for both,<sup>638</sup> and another study comparing ECP with the Ahmed drainage implant also showed comparable efficacy in lowering IOP, although the rate of complication with the latter surgery was higher.<sup>639</sup> A 2019 Cochrane Systematic Review found inconclusive evidence whether cyclodestructive procedures for refractory glaucoma result in better outcomes and fewer complications than other glaucoma treatments, or whether one cyclodestructive procedure is better than another.<sup>640</sup> Another 2019 Cochrane Systematic Review identified no studies on the effects of endocyclophotocoagulation for open-angle glaucoma.<sup>641</sup> Additional randomized clinical trials are needed to further elucidate the merits of each type of cyclophotocoagulation relative to one another as well as to other types of glaucoma surgery.<sup>640, 641</sup> Therefore, the selection of cyclophotocoagulation over other procedures should be left to the discretion of the treating ophthalmologist, in consultation with the individual patient.\n*(I., Insufficient Quality, Discretionary Recommendation)*\n## Other Therapeutic Considerations\nThere is a growing interest in complementary and alternative medicinal approaches to the treatment of glaucoma. There is a lack of conclusive scientific evidence that herbal medicines or nutritional supplements are beneficial in treating glaucoma.<sup>642–645</sup> Two reviews of the scientific evidence by the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Glaucoma Society found no support for increased benefit or diminished risk with the use of marijuana to treat glaucoma compared with conventional medications.<sup>646, 647</sup> Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggest that higher intensity exercise may reduce the risk of developing glaucoma.<sup>648</sup>\n## Follow-up Evaluation\nGuidelines for follow-up of patients with POAG are summarized in Table 7. These recommendations apply to ongoing glaucoma management and not to visits for other purposes. The purpose of follow-up examination is to evaluate IOP level, visual field status, and optic disc appearance as well as ONH, RNFL, and macular imaging to determine if progressive damage has occurred.\n#### Table 7: Consensus-Based Guidelines for Follow-up Glaucoma Status\n| Target IOP Achieved | Progression of Damage | Duration of Control (mos) | Approximate Follow-up Interval (mos)\\* |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Yes                 | No                    | ≤6                         | 6                                     |\n| Yes                 | No                    | >6                         | 6–12                                  |\n| Yes                 | Yes                   | NA                         | 1–2                                   |\n| No                  | Yes                   | NA                         | 1–2                                   |\n| No                  | No                    | NA                         | 3–6                                   |\n\\* IOP = intraocular pressure; NA = not applicable\n\\** Patients with more advanced damage or greater lifetime risk from primary open-angle glaucoma may require more frequent evaluations.
