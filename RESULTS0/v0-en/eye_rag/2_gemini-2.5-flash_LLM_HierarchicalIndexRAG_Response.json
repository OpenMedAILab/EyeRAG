    "response": "Based on your clinical data, you were diagnosed with left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and left eye senile cataract. You experienced a sudden onset of pain and blurred vision in your left eye, along with eye redness, photophobia, tearing, headache, and nausea. These are classic symptoms of an acute angle-closure crisis (AACC), which is a severe form of PACG.\n\nRegarding lifestyle changes to prevent further damage to your eyes, the provided medical literature on primary angle-closure disease (PACD) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) does not specifically detail lifestyle modifications for PACG. However, it does mention that higher intensity exercise may reduce the risk of developing glaucoma in the context of POAG. While this information is not directly about PACG, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, is generally beneficial for overall health.\n\nIt's important to understand that PACG has specific risk factors such as older age, female gender, and a thick and anteriorly positioned crystalline lens, which are consistent with your clinical profile. The primary treatments for acute angle-closure crisis involve medical treatment to lower intraocular pressure, followed by laser iridotomy or iridectomy, and potentially lens extraction. These interventions are crucial for managing the condition and preventing further damage.\n\nWhile specific lifestyle changes for PACG are not extensively covered in the provided literature, adhering to your prescribed medical treatments and follow-up appointments is paramount. Your ophthalmologist will monitor your intraocular pressure, visual field, and optic nerve health to ensure the best possible outcome and adjust your treatment plan as needed. If you have concerns about specific activities or lifestyle choices, please discuss them with your ophthalmologist.",

            "content": "## HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARE\nUnderstanding the current disease definition is important in the management of the primary angle-closure disease (PACD) spectrum. Modern classification includes:\n- Primary angle-closure suspect (PACS): ≥180 degrees iridotrabecular contact (ITC), normal intraocular pressure (IOP), and no optic nerve damage\n- Primary angle closure (PAC): ≥180 degrees ITC with peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) or elevated IOP but no optic neuropathy\n- Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG): ≥180 degrees ITC with PAS, elevated IOP, and optic neuropathy\n- Acute angle-closure crisis (AACC): occluded angle with symptomatic high IOP\n- Plateau iris configuration: narrow angle due to an anteriorly positioned ciliary body, with deep central anterior chamber\n- Plateau iris syndrome: narrow angle due to an anteriorly positioned ciliary body, with deep central anterior chamber, and any ITC persisting after patent peripheral iridotomy\nCommon risk factors for PACD include Asian descent, hyperopia, older age, female gender, short axial length, and thick and anteriorly positioned crystalline lens.\nDark-room dynamic gonioscopy should be performed to diagnose PACD and to verify improvement in angle configuration following treatment. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) can also aid in the diagnosis of angle closure, but only UBM and dynamic gonioscopy can identify the etiology of plateau iris.\nThe clinical signs and symptoms of AACC include pressure-induced corneal edema (experienced as blurred vision and occasionally as halos around lights), a mid-dilated pupil, vascular congestion (i.e., conjunctival and episcleral), eye pain, headache, and nausea/vomiting.\nPatients experiencing AACC should receive medical treatment, including aqueous suppressants, parasympathomimetics, and osmotic agents, if necessary, to lower the IOP acutely and relieve symptoms. This should be followed by laser iridotomy or iridectomy. After addressing the episode of AACC, it is important to perform laser iridotomy in the fellow eye when indicated.\nLens extraction is an effective treatment for some patients with PAC and PACG."

            "content": "## INTRODUCTION\n### DISEASE DEFINITION\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy in adults in which there is a characteristic acquired atrophy of the optic nerve and loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. This condition is associated with an open anterior chamber angle by gonioscopy. Primary open-angle glaucoma is a potentially blinding eye disease, but early diagnosis and treatment can generally prevent visual disability.\n### CLINICAL FINDINGS CHARACTERISTIC OF PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma is a chronic ocular disease process that is progressive, generally bilateral, but often asymmetric. It is associated with the following characteristics:\n- **Evidence of optic nerve damage from either, or both, of the following:**\n  - Optic disc or retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) structural abnormalities:\n    - Diffuse or focal narrowing, or notching, of the optic disc rim, especially at the inferior or superior poles, which forms the basis for the ISNT rule (see subsection on optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer clinical examination in Physical Examination section)\n    - Progressive narrowing of the neuroretinal rim with an associated increase in cupping of the optic disc\n    - Diffuse or localized thinning of the parapapillary RNFL, especially at the inferior or superior poles. (Highly myopic individuals without glaucoma may have diffusely thin RNFL.)\n    - Optic disc hemorrhages involving the disc rim, parapapillary RNFL, or lamina cribrosa\n    - Optic disc neural rim asymmetry of the two eyes consistent with loss of neural tissue\n    - Beta-zone parapapillary atrophy\n    - Thinning of the RNFL and/or macula on imaging\n  - Reliable and reproducible visual field abnormality:\n    - Visual field damage consistent with RNFL damage (e.g., nasal step, arcuate field defect, or paracentral depression in clusters of test sites)\n    - Visual field loss across the horizontal midline in one hemifield that exceeds loss in the opposite hemifield (in early/moderate cases)\n    - Absence of other known explanations (e.g., optic disc drusen, optic nerve pit, retinal or neurological pathology)\n- **Adult onset**\n- **Open anterior chamber angles**\n- **Absence of other known explanations** (i.e., secondary glaucoma) for progressive glaucomatous optic nerve change (e.g., pigment dispersion syndrome, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, uveitis, trauma, and corticosteroid use)\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma represents a spectrum of disease in adults in which the susceptibility of the optic nerve to damage varies among patients. Although many patients with POAG present with elevated IOP, nearly 40% of those with otherwise characteristic POAG may not have elevated IOP measurements during office hours. The vast majority of patients with POAG have disc changes or disc and visual field changes, but there are cases where early visual field changes may develop before there are detectable changes to the optic nerve.\nThe severity of glaucoma damage can be estimated according to the following categories:\n- **Mild:** Definite optic disc, RNFL, or macular imaging abnormalities consistent with glaucoma as detailed above and a normal visual field as tested with standard automated perimetry (SAP)\n- **Moderate:** Definite optic disc, RNFL, or macular imaging abnormalities consistent with glaucoma as detailed above, and visual field abnormalities in one hemifield that are not within 5 degrees of fixation\n## PATIENT POPULATION\nThe patient population consists of adults with open anterior chamber angles and demonstrated optic nerve or RNFL damage, and/or visual field loss.\n## CLINICAL OBJECTIVES\n- Document the status of the optic nerve structure at baseline by clinical evaluation and imaging, and document visual function by visual field testing\n- Estimate an IOP below which further optic nerve damage is unlikely to occur (see Target Intraocular Pressure subsection in the Care Process section)\n- Perform and document gonioscopy\n- Attempt to maintain IOP at or below a defined target level by initiating appropriate medical and/or surgical intervention(s) after discussing the options with the patient\n- Monitor the structure and function of the optic nerve for further damage and adjust the target IOP to a lower level if deterioration occurs\n- Minimize the side effects of treatment and their impact on the patient’s vision, general health, and quality of life\n- Educate and involve the patient and appropriate family members/caregivers in the management of the disease\n- Maintain quality of vision and preserve quality of life"

            "content": "## Endoscopic Cyclophotocoagulation\nEndoscopic cyclophotocoagulation<sup>633, 634, 637</sup> may be combined with cataract surgery. One randomized trial comparing cataract surgery combined with either ECP or trabeculectomy suggested that IOP lowering efficacy is similar for both,<sup>638</sup> and another study comparing ECP with the Ahmed drainage implant also showed comparable efficacy in lowering IOP, although the rate of complication with the latter surgery was higher.<sup>639</sup> A 2019 Cochrane Systematic Review found inconclusive evidence whether cyclodestructive procedures for refractory glaucoma result in better outcomes and fewer complications than other glaucoma treatments, or whether one cyclodestructive procedure is better than another.<sup>640</sup> Another 2019 Cochrane Systematic Review identified no studies on the effects of endocyclophotocoagulation for open-angle glaucoma.<sup>641</sup> Additional randomized clinical trials are needed to further elucidate the merits of each type of cyclophotocoagulation relative to one another as well as to other types of glaucoma surgery.<sup>640, 641</sup> Therefore, the selection of cyclophotocoagulation over other procedures should be left to the discretion of the treating ophthalmologist, in consultation with the individual patient.\n*(I., Insufficient Quality, Discretionary Recommendation)*\n## Other Therapeutic Considerations\nThere is a growing interest in complementary and alternative medicinal approaches to the treatment of glaucoma. There is a lack of conclusive scientific evidence that herbal medicines or nutritional supplements are beneficial in treating glaucoma.<sup>642–645</sup> Two reviews of the scientific evidence by the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Glaucoma Society found no support for increased benefit or diminished risk with the use of marijuana to treat glaucoma compared with conventional medications.<sup>646, 647</sup> Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggest that higher intensity exercise may reduce the risk of developing glaucoma.<sup>648</sup>\n## Follow-up Evaluation\nGuidelines for follow-up of patients with POAG are summarized in Table 7. These recommendations apply to ongoing glaucoma management and not to visits for other purposes. The purpose of follow-up examination is to evaluate IOP level, visual field status, and optic disc appearance as well as ONH, RNFL, and macular imaging to determine if progressive damage has occurred.\n#### Table 7: Consensus-Based Guidelines for Follow-up Glaucoma Status\n| Target IOP Achieved | Progression of Damage | Duration of Control (mos) | Approximate Follow-up Interval (mos)\\* |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Yes                 | No                    | ≤6                         | 6                                     |\n| Yes                 | No                    | >6                         | 6–12                                  |\n| Yes                 | Yes                   | NA                         | 1–2                                   |\n| No                  | Yes                   | NA                         | 1–2                                   |\n| No                  | No                    | NA                         | 3–6                                   |\n\\* IOP = intraocular pressure; NA = not applicable\n\\** Patients with more advanced damage or greater lifetime risk from primary open-angle glaucoma may require more frequent evaluations.
