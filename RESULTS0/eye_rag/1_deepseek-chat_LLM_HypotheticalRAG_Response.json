    "response": "Based on your clinical data and current medical guidelines, I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question**\nThe long-term prognosis for acute angle-closure glaucoma depends significantly on how quickly the condition was treated and whether there was permanent damage to your optic nerve during the acute attack. Your medical records show you were admitted with sudden onset of symptoms for 4 days before treatment, which is a critical factor in determining potential outcomes.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data**\nYour examination showed significant findings in your left eye: corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, elevated intraocular pressure (T+2), and vision reduced to 0.1 (compared to 0.4 in your right eye). These findings indicate you experienced a significant acute angle-closure crisis. The fact that you also have senile cataract in the same eye adds complexity to your situation, as cataract progression can contribute to angle closure over time.\n\n**Educational Information About Prognosis**\nAccording to medical guidelines, acute angle-closure glaucoma is classified separately from chronic forms. The key factors affecting your long-term prognosis include:\n\n1. **Timing of Treatment**: The sooner acute angle-closure is treated, the better the chance of preserving vision. Your 4-day delay before treatment may have allowed some optic nerve damage to occur.\n\n2. **Optic Nerve Status**: The most important determinant of long-term prognosis is whether permanent damage occurred to your optic nerve during the acute attack. This damage cannot be reversed, but further progression can be prevented with proper management.\n\n3. **Angle Status After Treatment**: Following laser peripheral iridotomy (the standard treatment), your angle may open completely or may have some areas of permanent synechial closure. This will determine whether you need ongoing medical therapy.\n\n4. **Ongoing Management Needs**: Even after successful treatment of the acute crisis, you will need regular monitoring. According to guidelines, patients with residual open angles or partial synechial closure require follow-up to check for increasing peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) and development of secondary angle closure from cataract progression.\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps**\n1. **Regular Follow-up**: You will need ongoing ophthalmologic care with regular intraocular pressure checks, gonioscopy to assess your angle status, and monitoring of your optic nerve health.\n\n2. **Cataract Management**: Your senile cataract may need to be addressed, as cataract progression can contribute to angle closure over time.\n\n3. **Potential for Medical Therapy**: If your intraocular pressure remains elevated long-term and you develop chronic angle-closure glaucoma, you may need ongoing medical therapy similar to that used for primary open-angle glaucoma.\n\n4. **Vision Rehabilitation**: If you experience substantial visual impairment, vision rehabilitation services may be beneficial to help you adapt to any vision loss.\n\nThe most important aspect of your long-term prognosis is preventing further damage through careful monitoring and appropriate treatment. While some vision loss may have occurred during your acute attack, proper management can help preserve your remaining vision and prevent further deterioration.",

            "content": "## INTRODUCTION\n### DISEASE DEFINITION\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy in adults in which there is a characteristic acquired atrophy of the optic nerve and loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. This condition is associated with an open anterior chamber angle by gonioscopy. Primary open-angle glaucoma is a potentially blinding eye disease, but early diagnosis and treatment can generally prevent visual disability.\n### CLINICAL FINDINGS CHARACTERISTIC OF PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma is a chronic ocular disease process that is progressive, generally bilateral, but often asymmetric. It is associated with the following characteristics:\n- **Evidence of optic nerve damage from either, or both, of the following:**\n  - Optic disc or retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) structural abnormalities:\n    - Diffuse or focal narrowing, or notching, of the optic disc rim, especially at the inferior or superior poles, which forms the basis for the ISNT rule (see subsection on optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer clinical examination in Physical Examination section)\n    - Progressive narrowing of the neuroretinal rim with an associated increase in cupping of the optic disc\n    - Diffuse or localized thinning of the parapapillary RNFL, especially at the inferior or superior poles. (Highly myopic individuals without glaucoma may have diffusely thin RNFL.)\n    - Optic disc hemorrhages involving the disc rim, parapapillary RNFL, or lamina cribrosa\n    - Optic disc neural rim asymmetry of the two eyes consistent with loss of neural tissue\n    - Beta-zone parapapillary atrophy\n    - Thinning of the RNFL and/or macula on imaging\n  - Reliable and reproducible visual field abnormality:\n    - Visual field damage consistent with RNFL damage (e.g., nasal step, arcuate field defect, or paracentral depression in clusters of test sites)\n    - Visual field loss across the horizontal midline in one hemifield that exceeds loss in the opposite hemifield (in early/moderate cases)\n    - Absence of other known explanations (e.g., optic disc drusen, optic nerve pit, retinal or neurological pathology)\n- **Adult onset**\n- **Open anterior chamber angles**\n- **Absence of other known explanations** (i.e., secondary glaucoma) for progressive glaucomatous optic nerve change (e.g., pigment dispersion syndrome, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, uveitis, trauma, and corticosteroid use)\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma represents a spectrum of disease in adults in which the susceptibility of the optic nerve to damage varies among patients. Although many patients with POAG present with elevated IOP, nearly 40% of those with otherwise characteristic POAG may not have elevated IOP measurements during office hours. The vast majority of patients with POAG have disc changes or disc and visual field changes, but there are cases where early visual field changes may develop before there are detectable changes to the optic nerve.\nThe severity of glaucoma damage can be estimated according to the following categories:\n- **Mild:** Definite optic disc, RNFL, or macular imaging abnormalities consistent with glaucoma as detailed above and a normal visual field as tested with standard automated perimetry (SAP)\n- **Moderate:** Definite optic disc, RNFL, or macular imaging abnormalities consistent with glaucoma as detailed above, and visual field abnormalities in one hemifield that are not within 5 degrees of fixation\n## PATIENT POPULATION\nThe patient population consists of adults with open anterior chamber angles and demonstrated optic nerve or RNFL damage, and/or visual field loss.\n## CLINICAL OBJECTIVES\n- Document the status of the optic nerve structure at baseline by clinical evaluation and imaging, and document visual function by visual field testing\n- Estimate an IOP below which further optic nerve damage is unlikely to occur (see Target Intraocular Pressure subsection in the Care Process section)\n- Perform and document gonioscopy\n- Attempt to maintain IOP at or below a defined target level by initiating appropriate medical and/or surgical intervention(s) after discussing the options with the patient\n- Monitor the structure and function of the optic nerve for further damage and adjust the target IOP to a lower level if deterioration occurs\n- Minimize the side effects of treatment and their impact on the patient’s vision, general health, and quality of life\n- Educate and involve the patient and appropriate family members/caregivers in the management of the disease\n- Maintain quality of vision and preserve quality of life"

            "content": "## Follow-up Evaluation\nThe recommendations for follow-up evaluations after iridotomy for angle closure apply to ongoing management of PACD and not to visits for other purposes. Following LPI, patients may have an open anterior chamber angle or an anterior chamber angle with a combination of open sectors with areas occluded by PAS. With or without glaucomatous optic neuropathy, patients with a residual open angle or a combination of open angle and some PAS should be followed at appropriate intervals to check for increasing PAS. Special attention should be given to repeat gonioscopy to determine interval changes such as increased extent of PAS or development of secondary angle closure from cataract progression and increased lens thickness. Subsequent follow-up intervals depend on the clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist.\nIf IOP remains elevated long term and the patient develops PAC or PACG, then ongoing medical therapy to lower IOP may become necessary. In such a situation, follow-up procedures and intervals would be dictated by the same principles outlined in the Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma PPP. As in primary open-angle glaucoma, adherence to medical therapy may be handicapped when patients run out of medication, due to inadvertent drop wastage or inability to properly instill eyedrops, before they are permitted to refill their prescription. One study found this was more likely for patients who self-administered eyedrop medications when visual acuity was worse than 20/70 in either eye. However, according to a 2010 directive, patients with Medicare insurance may now refill their medication after they have completed at least 70% of the month, or approximately 21 days of therapy.\n## PROVIDER AND SETTING\nThe performance of certain diagnostic procedures (e.g., tonometry, perimetry, pachymetry, anterior segment imaging, optic disc imaging, and photography) may be delegated to appropriately trained and supervised personnel. However, the interpretation of results and medical and surgical management of disease require the medical training, clinical judgment, and experience of the ophthalmologist. Most diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be undertaken safely on an outpatient basis. Hospitalization may be indicated for intensive treatment of an AACC so that patients can be monitored closely after surgical procedures associated with a high risk of serious short-term postoperative complications. It may also be indicated for patients who have experienced surgical complications or for patients who have special medical or social needs.\n## COUNSELING AND REFERRAL\nIf the diagnosis or management of PACD is in question or is refractory to treatment, consultation with or referral to an ophthalmologist with special training or experience in managing these conditions may be indicated. Patients with substantial visual impairment or blindness may benefit from appropriate vision rehabilitation and social services. More information on vision rehabilitation, including materials for patients, is available at [www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision](www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision).\n## SOCIOECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS\nAt the individual patient level, research has demonstrated that glaucomatous vision loss can have a dramatic impact on a patient’s well-being. Patients with glaucoma may struggle with daily activities such as reading, walking, and driving. Performance of these activities deteriorates with worsening of glaucoma severity and when both eyes are affected. Studies have reported that patients with glaucoma are three times more likely to experience falls and six times more likely to be involved in motor vehicle collisions compared with controls. Quality of life is affected for patients with all stages of glaucoma, even those with early disease.\nThe costs of managing a chronic disease like glaucoma can be broken down into direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs. Direct costs include costs of visits to eye care providers, ancillary testing, and medical and surgical interventions. One study estimated that nearly $3 billion USD per year is spent on the direct medical costs for all forms of glaucoma. Direct nonmedical"

The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct. The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field. If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters.\n- For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when no other code option available.\n- When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit):\n  - Right is always 1\n  - Left is always 2\n  - Bilateral is always 3\n## APPENDIX 3. ALGORITHM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE ANGLE-CLOSURE CRISIS\n#### FIGURE: Algorithm for the Management of Patients with Presumed Acute Angle-Closure Crisis\nThe flowchart outlines the management of patients with presumed acute angle-closure crisis (AACC). Key steps include initiating medical therapy to break the attack and prepare for laser iridotomy, assessing whether the view is clear, and proceeding with treatment options based on evidence for secondary causes or primary angle-closure disease mechanisms. Additional treatments such as topical glycerin, compression, paracentesis, or iridoplasty are suggested to clear the view if necessary. The algorithm includes steps for laser peripheral iridotomy, incisional iridectomy, and follow-up with dark-room gonioscopy to assess angle opening. Detailed measures for controlled and uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) are also described, considering both surgical and medical management options.\n**Key Abbreviations:**\n- **AACC**: acute angle-closure crisis\n- **ICE**: iridocorneal endothelial\n- **IOP**: intraocular pressure\n- **NVI**: neovascularization of the iris\n- **PACD**: primary angle closure disease\n*Note: Indicated for extensive synechial closure or optic nerve damage.*"
