    "response": "Based on your clinical data, I can provide you with specific lifestyle recommendations to help manage your eye condition and prevent further damage. Your diagnosis of **left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma** and **left eye senile cataract** requires particular attention to certain lifestyle factors.\n\n**Key Lifestyle Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Medication Adherence**: While not strictly a \"lifestyle\" change, the most critical step is following your prescribed treatment plan. Your acute angle-closure glaucoma requires careful management to prevent further damage to your optic nerve.\n\n2. **Sleep Position**: Given your shallow anterior chamber (less than 1/3 corneal thickness), you should avoid sleeping flat on your back. Sleeping with your head elevated on pillows can help reduce intraocular pressure during sleep.\n\n3. **Lighting Conditions**: Your symptoms included photophobia (light sensitivity). Use appropriate lighting - avoid very dim or very bright lighting extremes. Consider wearing sunglasses with UV protection when outdoors to reduce glare and discomfort.\n\n4. **Stress Management**: Stress can potentially affect intraocular pressure. Your clinical history mentions poor sleep and appetite during your acute episode. Developing stress-reduction techniques like gentle exercise (with your doctor's approval), meditation, or relaxation exercises may be beneficial.\n\n5. **Hydration Habits**: Drink fluids steadily throughout the day rather than consuming large amounts at once, as rapid fluid intake can temporarily increase intraocular pressure.\n\n6. **Regular Follow-up**: Maintain all scheduled ophthalmology appointments. Your vision measurements (VOD 0.4, VOS 0.1) and intraocular pressure (IOP OD Tn, OS T+2) need regular monitoring.\n\n7. **Avoid Eye Strain**: Given your decreased vision (0.1 in left eye), ensure adequate lighting for reading and close work to minimize strain.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n- **No self-medication**: Your medical history indicates no known drug allergies, but always consult your ophthalmologist before taking any new medications, as some drugs can affect intraocular pressure.\n\n- **Emergency awareness**: Be aware of glaucoma symptoms - sudden eye pain, vision loss, nausea, headache, and halos around lights. If these recur, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n- **Cataract management**: Your senile cataract will need monitoring, and your ophthalmologist will advise on appropriate timing for any surgical intervention.\n\nThese lifestyle adjustments, combined with your medical treatment, can help protect your remaining vision and prevent further damage to your eyes. Always discuss any significant lifestyle changes with your ophthalmologist to ensure they're appropriate for your specific condition.",

        "DischargeDiagnosis": "1. Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma; 2. Left eye senile cataract",
        "ClinicalHistory": "Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in the left eye for 4 days.\nHistory of Present Illness: Four days ago, the patient experienced sudden onset of distending pain in the left eye without obvious precipitating factors, accompanied by a rapid decrease in vision. Both distant and near vision were unclear, accompanied by irritative symptoms such as eye redness, photophobia, and tearing, as well as ipsilateral headache and nausea. Denies history of ocular trauma. As symptoms persisted without relief, the patient came to our hospital today for treatment. After relevant examinations in the outpatient clinic, the patient was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of \"1. Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma; 2. Bilateral pseudophakia.\" During the course of the illness, there was no fever or cough. Appetite and sleep were poor, but bowel movements and urination were normal.\nPast Medical History and Surgical/Trauma History: General condition: Usually in general good health. Denies history of chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease; denies history of blood transfusion or trauma. Denies history of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, bacillary dysentery, and typhoid fever. Immunizations completed on schedule. Denies allergies to sulfonamide drugs, streptomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, cephalosporins, other medications, or any known food allergies.\nOphthalmic Examination: Vod 0.4, Vos 0.1. IOP OD Tn, OS T+2. Right eye: conjunctiva without hyperemia, cornea clear, peripheral anterior chamber shallow, aqueous humor clear, pupil round with a diameter of approximately 3mm, reactive to light (+), lens turbid, fundus visible with retina attached, no obvious hemorrhage or exudation seen. Left eye: conjunctival mixed hyperemia (++), corneal opacity and edema, subepithelial bullae, KP (-), anterior chamber shallow, peripheral anterior chamber <1/3 CT, aqueous flare (+), pupil round with a diameter of approximately 4mm, reactive to light (+), lens turbid, fundus not visible.",
        "DifferentialDiagnosis": "1. Acute iridocyclitis: Sudden onset of eye redness, eye pain, varying degrees of vision loss, intraocular pressure usually not elevated, significant anterior chamber inflammatory reaction, pupil constricted and irregular in shape.\n2. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis: Patients are mostly young and middle-aged adults, acute sharp increase in intraocular pressure, local irritation symptoms are mild, anterior chamber is not shallow, open angle, mutton-fat KPs on the posterior cornea."
