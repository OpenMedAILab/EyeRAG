crystalline lens that affects vision. Most cataract development is related to aging, and it can occur in one or both eyes.\\n### PATIENT POPULATION\\nAdults (18 years old and older) with cataracts.\\n### CLINICAL OBJECTIVES\\n- Identify the presence and characteristics of a cataract.\\n- Assess the impact of cataract on a patient’s visual status and function as well as the effect on quality of life.\\n- Educate the patient about the natural history of cataract and its impact on vision and functional activity. Explain the benefits and risks of surgery and other treatment alternatives to enable the patient to make an informed decision about treatment options.\\n- Explain advantages and disadvantages of intraocular lens (IOL) options, including astigmatic, multifocal, extended depth of focus, accommodating, postoperatively power adjustable, and monovision IOL alternatives, to reduce the patient’s need for spectacles or contact lenses after surgery.\\n- Identify any ocular comorbidities, high-risk ocular features, or systemic issues that could impact the performance and outcomes of surgery.\\n- Establish criteria for a successful treatment outcome with the patient, including working distance(s) and potential limitations in visual outcome(s).\\n- Discuss potential postoperative refractive options, including bilateral emmetropia, bilateral myopia, and monovision, as well as the management of any anisometropia between surgical procedures.\\n- Perform cataract surgery when surgery will result in enhanced patient function and when the informed patient elects this option. Timing of surgery should be based on what is mutually agreeable between the patient and surgeon.\\n- Perform surgery when indicated for improved visualization and management of coexisting ocular disease, such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy.\\n- Provide appropriate postoperative care, visual rehabilitation, and treatment of any complications, such as elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or corneal edema.\\n- Improve patient safety by reducing the risk of traffic accidents, falls, and fractures.\\n## BACKGROUND\\n### PREVALENCE\\nCataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. The risk of cataract increases with each decade of life starting around age 40. Cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment among Americans of all studied ethnic and racial backgrounds. In the United States, the number of people with cataract is forecasted to double from 24.4 million to about 50 million by the year 2050.\\nThere are several different types of cataracts that can be categorized according to which part of the lens becomes opaque. Each type has its own anatomical location, pathology, and risks for development. The different types can exist separately or in various combinations. Several systems are available to classify and grade lens opacities, but variations in grading systems make it difficult to compare prevalence rates between studies.\\n## The Three Most Common Types of Cataracts\\nThe three most common types of cataracts are nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular. Less common are anterior subcapsular, anterior polar, and posterior polar cataracts. Nuclear cataract consists of a central opacification or discoloration of the lens that interferes with visual function. There are different types of nuclear cataract: brunescent, opalescent, or both. Nuclear cataract tends to progress slowly and affect distance vision more than near vision.\\nCortical cataract can be central or peripheral. It can take the appearance of opaque spokes or oil droplets. Patients with cortical cataract commonly complain of glare. When the entire cortex becomes white and opaque, the cataract is referred to as a mature cortical cataract.\\nPosterior subcapsular cataract (PSC), located just inside the posterior lens capsule, can cause substantial visual impairment if it involves the axial region of the lens. Patients with PSC often have glare symptoms and poor vision in bright light. Their near vision is typically more affected than distance due to miosis with near accommodation. In young patients, PSC is more common than nuclear and cortical cataract.\\nThree population-based studies found that cataract surgery was most frequently performed when PSC was a component of the cataract. In a study of an older population undergoing cataract surgery (mean age 79 years), the nuclear type was most frequently encountered.\", \"file_path\": \"medical_guide_markdown/Cataract in the Adult Eye PPP.md\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"content\": \"## NATURAL HISTORY\\nCataract typically progresses over time, although the type, severity, and rate of progression vary considerably among patients. With age, the lens increases in thickness and weight. Once visual acuity and function decline, the disease progresses with no chance of reversal. Three large studies demonstrate that PSCs progress more quickly than nuclear and cortical cataracts.²³, ¹⁰³⁻¹⁰⁵\\n## VISUAL FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE\\nThe multiple components of visual function include near, intermediate, and distance visual acuity; peripheral vision; visual search; binocular vision; depth perception; contrast sensitivity; color perception; dark adaptation; and visual processing speed.¹⁰⁶ Visual function can also be measured in terms of patient-reported disability caused by visual impairment.¹⁰⁷⁻¹¹¹ Many activities of daily living require adequate function of more than one of these visual components.\\nThe treatment outcomes that are the most crucial and relevant to the patient are improved visual function and quality of life. Well-designed studies consistently show that cataract surgery has a substantial positive impact on vision-dependent functioning. Up to 90% of patients undergoing first-eye cataract surgery note improvement in functional status and satisfaction with vision.¹¹²⁻¹¹⁶ Several studies report an association between improved visual function and an improved health-related quality of life.¹⁰⁹, ¹¹⁷⁻¹²⁰ Visual function plays an important role in physical performance and well-being,¹²¹⁻¹²³ particularly with regard to mobility.¹¹⁷, ¹²⁴ Loss of vision in the elderly is associated with a decline in physical and mental function as well as loss of independence in the activities of daily living.¹²⁵ Examples include daytime and nighttime driving as well as community and home activities. A 10-year evaluation of patients in the Blue Mountains Eye Study found that those who underwent cataract surgery experienced a significant improvement in mental health domain scores on the SF-36 questionnaire.¹²⁶ Cataract surgery may also help alleviate insomnia.¹²⁷, ¹²⁸ The very elderly (80+ to 85+ years, depending on the study) also benefit from cataract surgery, with benefits outweighing the risks.\\n## Benefits of Cataract Surgery\\nVisual impairment, such as poor depth perception and low contrast sensitivity, is an important risk factor for falls and fractures. In a randomized controlled trial, first-eye cataract surgery reduced the rate of falls and fracture by 34% over a 12-month period. Loss from cataract and the increased risk of falls are both contributory factors for nursing home placement. Additional studies show a reduction in mortality after cataract surgery, and evidence exists that waiting more than 4 months to perform cataract surgery after it is clearly indicated can result in vision-related complications such as falls and accidents. Similar improvement following second-eye surgery has also been confirmed. Second-eye cataract surgery also increases the sense of independence, reduces social isolation, and improves mood and the ability to interact socially.\\nA decrease in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity is associated with trouble driving. Drivers with visually significant cataract are 2.5 times more likely to have an at-fault motor vehicle crash over a 5-year period compared with drivers without cataract. In a cohort of 2777 patients with cataract, those who underwent surgery had half the rate of crash involvement compared with those who did not have surgery in a 4- to 6-year follow-up period. Patients who undergo cataract surgery are less likely to be in serious car crashes as the driver. One large study that assessed patients’ visual function preoperatively and postoperatively found the largest improvements in \\\"driving during the day,\\\" \\\"self-care activities,\\\" and \\\"driving during the night.\\\" Additionally, cataract surgery is shown to increase cognitive abilities in the very elderly. The majority of very elderly patients live at least 1 year following surgery, and many live much longer.\\nIn summary, numerous studies show that physical function, mental health, emotional well-being, safety, and overall quality of life can be enhanced when visual function is restored by cataract extraction.\\n### Improved Visual Function from Cataract Surgery\\nImproved visual function from cataract surgery can be characterized by the following:\\n- Improved distance-corrected visual acuity\\n- Increased ability to read or do near work\\n- Reduced glare\\n- Improved ability to function in dim light\\n- Improved depth perception and binocular vision by elimination of anisometropia and achievement of good functional acuity in both eyes\\n- Improved color vision\\n- Improved peripheral vision\\n### Improved Physical Function\\nImproved physical function as a beneficial outcome of cataract surgery can be characterized by the following:\\n- Increased ability to perform activities of daily living\\n- Increased ability to continue or resume an occupation\\n- Increased mobility (walking, driving)\\n- Decreased falls\\n- Improved sleep\\n### Improved Mental Health\\nImproved mental health and emotional well-being as another beneficial outcome of cataract surgery includes the following:\\n- Improved self-esteem and independence\\n- Improved injury avoidance\\n- Improved cognition\\n- Better social engagement and mood\", \"file_path\": \"medical_guide_markdown/Cataract in the Adult Eye PPP.md\"}, {\"id\": 3, \"content\": \"## MANAGEMENT\\n### Prevention\\nPreventive measures that impart even a modest decrease in the risk of cataract could have a large public health impact, given that 24.4 million people over the age of 40 years in the United States are affected by cataract.\\nThe role of diet and antioxidant supplements has been studied with mixed conclusions. A 2012 Cochrane Systematic Review of nine randomized controlled trials found no evidence to support high doses of vitamin E, vitamin C, or beta-carotene in preventing development or progression of cataract.\\nA more recent systematic review about the role of nutrient supplementation on lens pathology found that vitamin C, beta-carotene, and lutein and zeaxanthin had a protective effect against cataract, but this analysis included observational data.\\nThere is currently no level 1 evidence to suggest that high-dose antioxidant supplementation slows cataract progression. There is moderate evidence that a multivitamin/mineral supplement may decrease the risk of cataract.\\nSeveral observational studies also demonstrate the potential benefit of a healthy diet in preventing cataract.\\nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support a specific diet, but a well-balanced diet rich with fruits and vegetables is a reasonable recommendation based on observational studies. Appendix 3 summarizes studies of nutrition and cataract.\\nLong-term increased physical activity and exercise may decrease the risk of cataract. Additionally, long periods of inactivity and prolonged sitting may be associated with cataract progression.\\nThe effect of medications on the formation of cataract is difficult to study since the effect of the medication is hard to distinguish from the effect of the disease being treated. Long-term users of inhaled or oral corticosteroids are at higher risk of cataract formation. The use of intranasal corticosteroids, however, is not associated with a significant risk of incident cataract based on two recent systematic reviews.\\nThe association between statin use and cataract has been studied extensively with conflicting results.\\nPhenothiazines have been associated with anterior subcapsular opacities. Multiple studies show no benefit of aspirin on cataract development or the need for cataract surgery.\\nThere is a long list of drugs that may be associated with cataract in prevalence studies, but longitudinal studies are needed to confirm a causative relationship. Patients on medications who are at high risk for cataract formation should be counseled and monitored.\\nThe presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia) is associated with an increased risk of cataract or cataract surgery in numerous observational studies. Prevention and treatment of these conditions may reduce the risk of cataract.\\nSmoking is a risk factor for various types of cataracts, with a dose-response effect seen for nuclear sclerosis. Cessation of smoking reduces the risk of cataract development or progression and cataract surgery, and patients should be counseled to quit smoking.\\n## Nonsurgical Management\\nThe management of visually significant cataract is primarily surgical. However, there are nonsurgical means for managing the symptoms of cataract before surgery is necessary.\\nChanges to glasses and contact lens prescriptions can often be made to account for refractive shifts in the early stages of cataract development. Low-vision devices can maximize remaining vision pending cataract surgery or allow surgery to be deferred in patients at high risk of complications.\\nCurrently, no pharmacological treatments are known to eliminate existing cataract or retard its progression. Ophthalmologists should advise patients that, at this time, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacological treatments for cataract, based on a 2017 Cochrane Systematic Review of N-acetylcarnosine drops.\\nPatients who are long-term users of topical ophthalmic, periocular, oral, and inhaled corticosteroids should be informed of the increased risk of cataract development and may wish to discuss alternative treatments with their primary care physician. In limited circumstances, and often as a temporizing measure, the pupil can be dilated to provide better vision around a small central cataract. However, this strategy may worsen glare disability.\\n## Surgical Management\\nThe predominant method of cataract surgery in much of the world is sutureless, small-incision phacoemulsification with foldable IOL implantation performed on an outpatient basis. Sutures or sealants are used for incision closure if needed. In randomized clinical trials, phacoemulsification produces better uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and a lower rate of surgical complications, such as iris prolapse and posterior capsule rupture, than manual extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with incision closure by sutures or manual small-incision cataract extraction (MSICS). Phacoemulsification limits the astigmatic changes that occur with larger incisions and enables both astigmatism management and the implantation of specialty IOLs.\\nIn economically disadvantaged countries, MSICS remains popular because of its cost-effectiveness, and sutureless ECCE with IOL implantation performed very well compared with phacoemulsification in one randomized clinical trial.\\n### Indications for Surgery\\nThe primary indication for cataract surgery is a decline in visual function such that it no longer meets a patient’s visual needs and for which surgery provides a reasonable likelihood of improvement. Other indications for cataract removal include the following:\\n- There is clinically significant anisometropia in the presence of a cataract.\\n- A lens opacity interferes with optimal diagnosis or management of posterior segment pathology.\\n- A lens causes inflammation and related secondary glaucoma (phacolytic, lens particle, phacoantigenic).\\n- The lens induces primary angle closure or other forms of lens-related glaucoma.\\n### Contraindications to Surgery\\nSurgery for a cataract should not be performed under the following circumstances:\", \"file_path\": \"medical_guide_markdown/Cataract in the Adult Eye PPP.md\"}]\n```\n\n",
