            "content": "## NATURAL HISTORY\nCataract typically progresses over time, although the type, severity, and rate of progression vary considerably among patients. With age, the lens increases in thickness and weight. Once visual acuity and function decline, the disease progresses with no chance of reversal. Three large studies demonstrate that PSCs progress more quickly than nuclear and cortical cataracts.²³, ¹⁰³⁻¹⁰⁵\n## VISUAL FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE\nThe multiple components of visual function include near, intermediate, and distance visual acuity; peripheral vision; visual search; binocular vision; depth perception; contrast sensitivity; color perception; dark adaptation; and visual processing speed.¹⁰⁶ Visual function can also be measured in terms of patient-reported disability caused by visual impairment.¹⁰⁷⁻¹¹¹ Many activities of daily living require adequate function of more than one of these visual components.\nThe treatment outcomes that are the most crucial and relevant to the patient are improved visual function and quality of life. Well-designed studies consistently show that cataract surgery has a substantial positive impact on vision-dependent functioning. Up to 90% of patients undergoing first-eye cataract surgery note improvement in functional status and satisfaction with vision.¹¹²⁻¹¹⁶ Several studies report an association between improved visual function and an improved health-related quality of life.¹⁰⁹, ¹¹⁷⁻¹²⁰ Visual function plays an important role in physical performance and well-being,¹²¹⁻¹²³ particularly with regard to mobility.¹¹⁷, ¹²⁴ Loss of vision in the elderly is associated with a decline in physical and mental function as well as loss of independence in the activities of daily living.¹²⁵ Examples include daytime and nighttime driving as well as community and home activities. A 10-year evaluation of patients in the Blue Mountains Eye Study found that those who underwent cataract surgery experienced a significant improvement in mental health domain scores on the SF-36 questionnaire.¹²⁶ Cataract surgery may also help alleviate insomnia.¹²⁷, ¹²⁸ The very elderly (80+ to 85+ years, depending on the study) also benefit from cataract surgery, with benefits outweighing the risks."

            "content": "## HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARE\nSymptomatic cataract is a surgical disorder. Dietary intake and nutritional supplements have demonstrated minimal effect on the prevention or treatment of cataract.\nMost cataract surgery in the United States is performed by small-incision phacoemulsification with foldable intraocular lens (IOL) implantation on an outpatient basis.\nRefractive cataract surgery, including astigmatism management, intraoperative refractive guidance, and specialty IOL implantation, has the potential to reduce a patient’s dependence on eyeglasses or contact lenses for distance, intermediate, and near vision.\nFemtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) increases the circularity and centration of the capsulorrhexis and the precision of the corneal incisions. It may also reduce the amount of ultrasonic energy required to remove a cataract. However, the technology is not yet cost-effective, and the overall risk profile and refractive outcomes have not been shown to be superior to that of standard phacoemulsification.\nTopical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce the incidence of early postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME), but a long-term benefit has not been demonstrated.\nThere is substantial evidence that intracameral antibiotic administration reduces the risk of postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis. Increasing evidence also suggests that topically applied antibiotics do not add to the benefit of intracameral injection.\nMinimally invasive glaucoma surgery can enhance the intraocular pressure-lowering effects of cataract surgery in some patients with mild to moderate glaucoma.\n## INTRODUCTION\n### DISEASE DEFINITION\nA cataract is a degradation of the optical quality of the crystalline lens that affects vision. Most cataract development is related to aging, and it can occur in one or both eyes.\n### PATIENT POPULATION\nAdults (18 years old and older) with cataracts.\n### CLINICAL OBJECTIVES\n- Identify the presence and characteristics of a cataract.\n- Assess the impact of cataract on a patient’s visual status and function as well as the effect on quality of life.\n- Educate the patient about the natural history of cataract and its impact on vision and functional activity. Explain the benefits and risks of surgery and other treatment alternatives to enable the patient to make an informed decision about treatment options.\n- Explain advantages and disadvantages of intraocular lens (IOL) options, including astigmatic, multifocal, extended depth of focus, accommodating, postoperatively power adjustable, and monovision IOL alternatives, to reduce the patient’s need for spectacles or contact lenses after surgery.\n- Identify any ocular comorbidities, high-risk ocular features, or systemic issues that could impact the performance and outcomes of surgery.\n- Establish criteria for a successful treatment outcome with the patient, including working distance(s) and potential limitations in visual outcome(s).\n- Discuss potential postoperative refractive options, including bilateral emmetropia, bilateral myopia, and monovision, as well as the management of any anisometropia between surgical procedures.\n- Perform cataract surgery when surgery will result in enhanced patient function and when the informed patient elects this option. Timing of surgery should be based on what is mutually agreeable between the patient and surgeon.\n- Perform surgery when indicated for improved visualization and management of coexisting ocular disease, such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy.\n- Provide appropriate postoperative care, visual rehabilitation, and treatment of any complications, such as elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or corneal edema.\n- Improve patient safety by reducing the risk of traffic accidents, falls, and fractures.\n## BACKGROUND\n### PREVALENCE\nCataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. The risk of cataract increases with each decade of life starting around age 40. Cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment among Americans of all studied ethnic and racial backgrounds. In the United States, the number of people with cataract is forecasted to double from 24.4 million to about 50 million by the year 2050.\nThere are several different types of cataracts that can be categorized according to which part of the lens becomes opaque. Each type has its own anatomical location, pathology, and risks for development. The different types can exist separately or in various combinations. Several systems are available to classify and grade lens opacities, but variations in grading systems make it difficult to compare prevalence rates between studies."

            "content": "## Surgical Management\nThe predominant method of cataract surgery in much of the world is sutureless, small-incision phacoemulsification with foldable IOL implantation performed on an outpatient basis. Sutures or sealants are used for incision closure if needed. In randomized clinical trials, phacoemulsification produces better uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and a lower rate of surgical complications, such as iris prolapse and posterior capsule rupture, than manual extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with incision closure by sutures or manual small-incision cataract extraction (MSICS). Phacoemulsification limits the astigmatic changes that occur with larger incisions and enables both astigmatism management and the implantation of specialty IOLs.\nIn economically disadvantaged countries, MSICS remains popular because of its cost-effectiveness, and sutureless ECCE with IOL implantation performed very well compared with phacoemulsification in one randomized clinical trial.\n### Indications for Surgery\nThe primary indication for cataract surgery is a decline in visual function such that it no longer meets a patient’s visual needs and for which surgery provides a reasonable likelihood of improvement. Other indications for cataract removal include the following:\n- There is clinically significant anisometropia in the presence of a cataract.\n- A lens opacity interferes with optimal diagnosis or management of posterior segment pathology.\n- A lens causes inflammation and related secondary glaucoma (phacolytic, lens particle, phacoantigenic).\n- The lens induces primary angle closure or other forms of lens-related glaucoma.\n### Contraindications to Surgery\nSurgery for a cataract should not be performed under the following circumstances:\n## Preoperative Evaluation and Counseling\nThe ophthalmologist who will perform cataract surgery should do the following:\n- Examine the patient preoperatively (see Ophthalmic Evaluation section).\n- Ensure that the documented evaluation accurately reflects the symptoms, findings, and indications for treatment.\n- Obtain informed consent from the patient or the patient’s surrogate decision maker after discussing the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery, including the patient’s expected surgical experience and the anticipated refractive outcome.\n- Review the results of the presurgical evaluation with the patient or the patient’s surrogate decision maker.\n- Counsel the patient about postoperative refractive options, such as bilateral emmetropia, bilateral myopia, or monovision, that will work best given the ophthalmic history and patient’s desires.\n- Counsel the patient about elective refractive options, such as astigmatism management, intraoperative refractive guidance, specialty IOLs (toric, extended depth of focus, multifocal, accommodating, and postoperative power adjustable), and postoperative refractive enhancement.\n- Consider the effect of ocular comorbidities in the cataract care process.\n- Formulate a plan, including preoperative medical management, selection of appropriate anesthesia, surgical approach, concurrent procedures, and IOL design and power.\n- Assess relevant aspects of the patient’s mental and physical status, such as the ability to cooperate and position for surgery.\n- Formulate a postoperative care plan and inform the patient or the patient’s surrogate decision maker of these arrangements (setting of care, care provider).\n- Determine the effect of any concurrent upper-eyelid blepharoptosis. Blepharoptosis can induce corneal astigmatism or make astigmatism more difficult to measure. Additionally, cataract surgery can worsen blepharoptosis.\n- Answer the patient’s questions about the surgery and care, including associated costs.\n- Assess barriers to communication, including language or hearing impairment.\n- Ensure that the patient and the patient’s caregiver, if applicable, are committed and able to attend the postoperative visits and address transportation, medication administration, and other potential challenges.\nIdeally, the operating ophthalmologist should perform the preoperative assessment because this allows the surgeon to formulate a plan and establish a relationship with the patient before surgery. Although the ophthalmologist is responsible for the examination and review of the data, certain aspects of data collection may be conducted by other trained team members under the ophthalmologist’s supervision and within his or her review.\nPatients undergoing cataract surgery frequently have a preoperative medical evaluation, including a history and physical examination that takes into consideration the risk factors for undergoing the planned anesthesia. However, three randomized clinical trials have failed to show that this evaluation reduces systemic or ocular complications and no trials have shown it to be efficacious. For patients with certain severe systemic diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, poorly controlled arterial blood pressure, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, poorly controlled congestive heart failure, or poorly controlled diabetes), additional evaluation and management may be indicated."
