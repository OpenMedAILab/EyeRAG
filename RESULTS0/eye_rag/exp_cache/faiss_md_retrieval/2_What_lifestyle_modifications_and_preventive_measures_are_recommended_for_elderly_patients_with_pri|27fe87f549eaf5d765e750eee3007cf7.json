            "content": "## Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Preferred Practice Pattern\n### Background:\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic, progressive ocular disease causing loss of the optic nerve rim and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) with associated visual field defects. The anterior chamber angle is open, and the disease is generally bilateral. Risk factors for POAG include older age, African race or Latino/Hispanic ethnicity, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), family history of glaucoma, lower ocular perfusion pressure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thin central cornea. It is estimated that 53 million people in the world have POAG in 2020 with a prevalence of 3.0% in the population aged 40 to 80 years.\n### Rationale for Treatment:\nClinical trials have shown that lowering IOP reduces the risk of developing POAG and slows the progression of the disease. Medical, laser, and incisional surgical approaches exist to effectively lower IOP. Early diagnosis and treatment generally prevent visual disability.\n### Care Process:\nThe goals of managing patients with POAG are to control IOP in a target range and to prevent progressive visual field and optic nerve/RNFL damage in order to preserve visual function and quality of life. The initial glaucoma evaluation includes all components of the comprehensive adult medical evaluation focusing on those elements that specifically pertain to the diagnosis and management of POAG. Important diagnostic testing includes central corneal thickness measurement, visual field evaluation, and imaging of the optic nerve head, RNFL and macula. The relative risks and benefits of treatment with medications, laser therapy, or incisional surgery should be discussed with the patient prior to its initiation. The adequacy of treatment is determined during follow-up by regular assessment of the optic nerve appearance and quantitative evaluation with visual field testing and imaging of the optic nerve head, RNFL and macula."

            "content": "## MANAGEMENT\n### Prevention\nPreventive measures that impart even a modest decrease in the risk of cataract could have a large public health impact, given that 24.4 million people over the age of 40 years in the United States are affected by cataract.\nThe role of diet and antioxidant supplements has been studied with mixed conclusions. A 2012 Cochrane Systematic Review of nine randomized controlled trials found no evidence to support high doses of vitamin E, vitamin C, or beta-carotene in preventing development or progression of cataract.\nA more recent systematic review about the role of nutrient supplementation on lens pathology found that vitamin C, beta-carotene, and lutein and zeaxanthin had a protective effect against cataract, but this analysis included observational data.\nThere is currently no level 1 evidence to suggest that high-dose antioxidant supplementation slows cataract progression. There is moderate evidence that a multivitamin/mineral supplement may decrease the risk of cataract.\nSeveral observational studies also demonstrate the potential benefit of a healthy diet in preventing cataract.\nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support a specific diet, but a well-balanced diet rich with fruits and vegetables is a reasonable recommendation based on observational studies. Appendix 3 summarizes studies of nutrition and cataract.\nLong-term increased physical activity and exercise may decrease the risk of cataract. Additionally, long periods of inactivity and prolonged sitting may be associated with cataract progression.\nThe effect of medications on the formation of cataract is difficult to study since the effect of the medication is hard to distinguish from the effect of the disease being treated. Long-term users of inhaled or oral corticosteroids are at higher risk of cataract formation. The use of intranasal corticosteroids, however, is not associated with a significant risk of incident cataract based on two recent systematic reviews.\nThe association between statin use and cataract has been studied extensively with conflicting results.\nPhenothiazines have been associated with anterior subcapsular opacities. Multiple studies show no benefit of aspirin on cataract development or the need for cataract surgery.\nThere is a long list of drugs that may be associated with cataract in prevalence studies, but longitudinal studies are needed to confirm a causative relationship. Patients on medications who are at high risk for cataract formation should be counseled and monitored.\nThe presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia) is associated with an increased risk of cataract or cataract surgery in numerous observational studies. Prevention and treatment of these conditions may reduce the risk of cataract.\nSmoking is a risk factor for various types of cataracts, with a dose-response effect seen for nuclear sclerosis. Cessation of smoking reduces the risk of cataract development or progression and cataract surgery, and patients should be counseled to quit smoking.\n## Nonsurgical Management\nThe management of visually significant cataract is primarily surgical. However, there are nonsurgical means for managing the symptoms of cataract before surgery is necessary.\nChanges to glasses and contact lens prescriptions can often be made to account for refractive shifts in the early stages of cataract development. Low-vision devices can maximize remaining vision pending cataract surgery or allow surgery to be deferred in patients at high risk of complications.\nCurrently, no pharmacological treatments are known to eliminate existing cataract or retard its progression. Ophthalmologists should advise patients that, at this time, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacological treatments for cataract, based on a 2017 Cochrane Systematic Review of N-acetylcarnosine drops.\nPatients who are long-term users of topical ophthalmic, periocular, oral, and inhaled corticosteroids should be informed of the increased risk of cataract development and may wish to discuss alternative treatments with their primary care physician. In limited circumstances, and often as a temporizing measure, the pupil can be dilated to provide better vision around a small central cataract. However, this strategy may worsen glare disability."

            "content": "## HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARE\nUnderstanding the current disease definition is important in the management of the primary angle-closure disease (PACD) spectrum. Modern classification includes:\n- Primary angle-closure suspect (PACS): ≥180 degrees iridotrabecular contact (ITC), normal intraocular pressure (IOP), and no optic nerve damage\n- Primary angle closure (PAC): ≥180 degrees ITC with peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) or elevated IOP but no optic neuropathy\n- Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG): ≥180 degrees ITC with PAS, elevated IOP, and optic neuropathy\n- Acute angle-closure crisis (AACC): occluded angle with symptomatic high IOP\n- Plateau iris configuration: narrow angle due to an anteriorly positioned ciliary body, with deep central anterior chamber\n- Plateau iris syndrome: narrow angle due to an anteriorly positioned ciliary body, with deep central anterior chamber, and any ITC persisting after patent peripheral iridotomy\nCommon risk factors for PACD include Asian descent, hyperopia, older age, female gender, short axial length, and thick and anteriorly positioned crystalline lens.\nDark-room dynamic gonioscopy should be performed to diagnose PACD and to verify improvement in angle configuration following treatment. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) can also aid in the diagnosis of angle closure, but only UBM and dynamic gonioscopy can identify the etiology of plateau iris.\nThe clinical signs and symptoms of AACC include pressure-induced corneal edema (experienced as blurred vision and occasionally as halos around lights), a mid-dilated pupil, vascular congestion (i.e., conjunctival and episcleral), eye pain, headache, and nausea/vomiting.\nPatients experiencing AACC should receive medical treatment, including aqueous suppressants, parasympathomimetics, and osmotic agents, if necessary, to lower the IOP acutely and relieve symptoms. This should be followed by laser iridotomy or iridectomy. After addressing the episode of AACC, it is important to perform laser iridotomy in the fellow eye when indicated.\nLens extraction is an effective treatment for some patients with PAC and PACG."
