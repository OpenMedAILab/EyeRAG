This condition is associated with an open anterior chamber angle by gonioscopy. Primary open-angle glaucoma is a potentially blinding eye disease, but early diagnosis and treatment can generally prevent visual disability.\n### CLINICAL FINDINGS CHARACTERISTIC OF PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma is a chronic ocular disease process that is progressive, generally bilateral, but often asymmetric. It is associated with the following characteristics:\n- **Evidence of optic nerve damage from either, or both, of the following:**\n  - Optic disc or retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) structural abnormalities:\n    - Diffuse or focal narrowing, or notching, of the optic disc rim, especially at the inferior or superior poles, which forms the basis for the ISNT rule (see subsection on optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer clinical examination in Physical Examination section)\n    - Progressive narrowing of the neuroretinal rim with an associated increase in cupping of the optic disc\n    - Diffuse or localized thinning of the parapapillary RNFL, especially at the inferior or superior poles. (Highly myopic individuals without glaucoma may have diffusely thin RNFL.)\n    - Optic disc hemorrhages involving the disc rim, parapapillary RNFL, or lamina cribrosa\n    - Optic disc neural rim asymmetry of the two eyes consistent with loss of neural tissue\n    - Beta-zone parapapillary atrophy\n    - Thinning of the RNFL and/or macula on imaging\n  - Reliable and reproducible visual field abnormality:\n    - Visual field damage consistent with RNFL damage (e.g., nasal step, arcuate field defect, or paracentral depression in clusters of test sites)\n    - Visual field loss across the horizontal midline in one hemifield that exceeds loss in the opposite hemifield (in early/moderate cases)\n    - Absence of other known explanations (e.g., optic disc drusen, optic nerve pit, retinal or neurological pathology)\n- **Adult onset**\n- **Open anterior chamber angles**\n- **Absence of other known explanations** (i.e., secondary glaucoma) for progressive glaucomatous optic nerve change (e.g., pigment dispersion syndrome, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, uveitis, trauma, and corticosteroid use)\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma represents a spectrum of disease in adults in which the susceptibility of the optic nerve to damage varies among patients. Although many patients with POAG present with elevated IOP, nearly 40% of those with otherwise characteristic POAG may not have elevated IOP measurements during office hours. The vast majority of patients with POAG have disc changes or disc and visual field changes, but there are cases where early visual field changes may develop before there are detectable changes to the optic nerve.\nThe severity of glaucoma damage can be estimated according to the following categories:\n- **Mild:** Definite optic disc, RNFL, or macular imaging abnormalities consistent with glaucoma as detailed above and a normal visual field as tested with standard automated perimetry (SAP)\n- **Moderate:** Definite optic disc, RNFL, or macular imaging abnormalities consistent with glaucoma as detailed above, and visual field abnormalities in one hemifield that are not within 5 degrees of fixation\n## PATIENT POPULATION\nThe patient population consists of adults with open anterior chamber angles and demonstrated optic nerve or RNFL damage, and/or visual field loss.\n## CLINICAL OBJECTIVES\n- Document the status of the optic nerve structure at baseline by clinical evaluation and imaging, and document visual function by visual field testing\n- Estimate an IOP below which further optic nerve damage is unlikely to occur (see Target Intraocular Pressure subsection in the Care Process section)\n- Perform and document gonioscopy\n- Attempt to maintain IOP at or below a defined target level by initiating appropriate medical and/or surgical intervention(s) after discussing the options with the patient\n- Monitor the structure and function of the optic nerve for further damage and adjust the target IOP to a lower level if deterioration occurs\n- Minimize the side effects of treatment and their impact on the patient’s vision, general health, and quality of life\n- Educate and involve the patient and appropriate family members/caregivers in the management of the disease\n- Maintain quality of vision and preserve quality of life"

            "content": "## Follow-up Evaluation\nThe recommendations for follow-up evaluations after iridotomy for angle closure apply to ongoing management of PACD and not to visits for other purposes. Following LPI, patients may have an open anterior chamber angle or an anterior chamber angle with a combination of open sectors with areas occluded by PAS. With or without glaucomatous optic neuropathy, patients with a residual open angle or a combination of open angle and some PAS should be followed at appropriate intervals to check for increasing PAS. Special attention should be given to repeat gonioscopy to determine interval changes such as increased extent of PAS or development of secondary angle closure from cataract progression and increased lens thickness. Subsequent follow-up intervals depend on the clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist.\nIf IOP remains elevated long term and the patient develops PAC or PACG, then ongoing medical therapy to lower IOP may become necessary. In such a situation, follow-up procedures and intervals would be dictated by the same principles outlined in the Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma PPP. As in primary open-angle glaucoma, adherence to medical therapy may be handicapped when patients run out of medication, due to inadvertent drop wastage or inability to properly instill eyedrops, before they are permitted to refill their prescription. One study found this was more likely for patients who self-administered eyedrop medications when visual acuity was worse than 20/70 in either eye. However, according to a 2010 directive, patients with Medicare insurance may now refill their medication after they have completed at least 70% of the month, or approximately 21 days of therapy.\n## PROVIDER AND SETTING\nThe performance of certain diagnostic procedures (e.g., tonometry, perimetry, pachymetry, anterior segment imaging, optic disc imaging, and photography) may be delegated to appropriately trained and supervised personnel. However, the interpretation of results and medical and surgical management of disease require the medical training, clinical judgment, and experience of the ophthalmologist. Most diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be undertaken safely on an outpatient basis. Hospitalization may be indicated for intensive treatment of an AACC so that patients can be monitored closely after surgical procedures associated with a high risk of serious short-term postoperative complications. It may also be indicated for patients who have experienced surgical complications or for patients who have special medical or social needs.\n## COUNSELING AND REFERRAL\nIf the diagnosis or management of PACD is in question or is refractory to treatment, consultation with or referral to an ophthalmologist with special training or experience in managing these conditions may be indicated. Patients with substantial visual impairment or blindness may benefit from appropriate vision rehabilitation and social services. More information on vision rehabilitation, including materials for patients, is available at [www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision](www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision).\n## SOCIOECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS\nAt the individual patient level, research has demonstrated that glaucomatous vision loss can have a dramatic impact on a patient’s well-being. Patients with glaucoma may struggle with daily activities such as reading, walking, and driving. Performance of these activities deteriorates with worsening of glaucoma severity and when both eyes are affected. Studies have reported that patients with glaucoma are three times more likely to experience falls and six times more likely to be involved in motor vehicle collisions compared with controls. Quality of life is affected for patients with all stages of glaucoma, even those with early disease.\nThe costs of managing a chronic disease like glaucoma can be broken down into direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs. Direct costs include costs of visits to eye care providers, ancillary testing, and medical and surgical interventions. One study estimated that nearly $3 billion USD per year is spent on the direct medical costs for all forms of glaucoma. Direct nonmedical"

The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct. The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field. If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters.\n- For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when no other code option available.\n- When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit):\n  - Right is always 1\n  - Left is always 2\n  - Bilateral is always 3\n## APPENDIX 3. ALGORITHM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE ANGLE-CLOSURE CRISIS\n#### FIGURE: Algorithm for the Management of Patients with Presumed Acute Angle-Closure Crisis\nThe flowchart outlines the management of patients with presumed acute angle-closure crisis (AACC). Key steps include initiating medical therapy to break the attack and prepare for laser iridotomy, assessing whether the view is clear, and proceeding with treatment options based on evidence for secondary causes or primary angle-closure disease mechanisms. Additional treatments such as topical glycerin, compression, paracentesis, or iridoplasty are suggested to clear the view if necessary. The algorithm includes steps for laser peripheral iridotomy, incisional iridectomy, and follow-up with dark-room gonioscopy to assess angle opening. Detailed measures for controlled and uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) are also described, considering both surgical and medical management options.\n**Key Abbreviations:**\n- **AACC**: acute angle-closure crisis\n- **ICE**: iridocorneal endothelial\n- **IOP**: intraocular pressure\n- **NVI**: neovascularization of the iris\n- **PACD**: primary angle closure disease\n*Note: Indicated for extensive synechial closure or optic nerve damage.*"

    "query": "Based on your clinical data, I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nThe long-term prognosis for primary acute angle-closure glaucoma depends on several factors, including how quickly the condition was treated, the extent of optic nerve damage that occurred during the acute attack, and how well the intraocular pressure (IOP) is controlled going forward. With appropriate treatment and management, many patients can preserve useful vision and prevent further damage.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYou were admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in your left eye for 4 days, which was diagnosed as primary acute angle-closure glaucoma. Your examination showed significantly elevated intraocular pressure in the left eye (T+2), corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, and other signs consistent with an acute angle-closure attack. You also have senile cataract in both eyes.\n\n**Educational Information:**\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma is an ocular emergency where the drainage angle of the eye suddenly becomes blocked, causing a rapid increase in intraocular pressure. This can damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting visual information to your brain. The long-term outlook depends on:\n\n1. **Timeliness of treatment:** You sought treatment within 4 days of symptom onset, which is important for minimizing permanent damage.\n2. **Degree of optic nerve damage:** This is assessed through specialized testing that may not be fully documented in your admission records.\n3. **Ongoing pressure control:** After the acute attack is resolved, you'll need ongoing management to prevent recurrence and further damage.\n4. **Follow-up care:** Regular monitoring of intraocular pressure, optic nerve health, and visual field testing will be essential.\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps:**\n1. **Complete your current treatment:** Follow through with the treatment plan established during your hospitalization.\n2. **Regular follow-up:** You will need regular ophthalmology appointments to monitor your intraocular pressure, optic nerve health, and visual fields.\n3. **Consider preventive treatment:** Your right eye may be at risk for angle-closure glaucoma, so your ophthalmologist will likely discuss preventive measures.\n4. **Cataract management:** Your senile cataracts may need to be addressed, as cataract surgery can sometimes help improve drainage in angle-closure glaucoma.\n5. **Medication adherence:** If prescribed eye drops or other medications, consistent use is crucial for long-term pressure control.\n\nThe goal of treatment is to preserve your remaining vision and prevent further optic nerve damage. With proper management, many patients maintain functional vision and good quality of life. Your specific prognosis will become clearer as your ophthalmologist monitors your response to treatment over time.",
