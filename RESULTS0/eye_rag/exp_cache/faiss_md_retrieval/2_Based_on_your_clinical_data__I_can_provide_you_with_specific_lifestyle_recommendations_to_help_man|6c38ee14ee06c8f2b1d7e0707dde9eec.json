            "content": "## Endoscopic Cyclophotocoagulation\nEndoscopic cyclophotocoagulation<sup>633, 634, 637</sup> may be combined with cataract surgery. One randomized trial comparing cataract surgery combined with either ECP or trabeculectomy suggested that IOP lowering efficacy is similar for both,<sup>638</sup> and another study comparing ECP with the Ahmed drainage implant also showed comparable efficacy in lowering IOP, although the rate of complication with the latter surgery was higher.<sup>639</sup> A 2019 Cochrane Systematic Review found inconclusive evidence whether cyclodestructive procedures for refractory glaucoma result in better outcomes and fewer complications than other glaucoma treatments, or whether one cyclodestructive procedure is better than another.<sup>640</sup> Another 2019 Cochrane Systematic Review identified no studies on the effects of endocyclophotocoagulation for open-angle glaucoma.<sup>641</sup> Additional randomized clinical trials are needed to further elucidate the merits of each type of cyclophotocoagulation relative to one another as well as to other types of glaucoma surgery.<sup>640, 641</sup> Therefore, the selection of cyclophotocoagulation over other procedures should be left to the discretion of the treating ophthalmologist, in consultation with the individual patient.\n*(I., Insufficient Quality, Discretionary Recommendation)*\n## Other Therapeutic Considerations\nThere is a growing interest in complementary and alternative medicinal approaches to the treatment of glaucoma. There is a lack of conclusive scientific evidence that herbal medicines or nutritional supplements are beneficial in treating glaucoma.<sup>642–645</sup> Two reviews of the scientific evidence by the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Glaucoma Society found no support for increased benefit or diminished risk with the use of marijuana to treat glaucoma compared with conventional medications.<sup>646, 647</sup> Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggest that higher intensity exercise may reduce the risk of developing glaucoma.<sup>648</sup>\n## Follow-up Evaluation\nGuidelines for follow-up of patients with POAG are summarized in Table 7. These recommendations apply to ongoing glaucoma management and not to visits for other purposes. The purpose of follow-up examination is to evaluate IOP level, visual field status, and optic disc appearance as well as ONH, RNFL, and macular imaging to determine if progressive damage has occurred.\n#### Table 7: Consensus-Based Guidelines for Follow-up Glaucoma Status\n| Target IOP Achieved | Progression of Damage | Duration of Control (mos) | Approximate Follow-up Interval (mos)\\* |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Yes                 | No                    | ≤6                         | 6                                     |\n| Yes                 | No                    | >6                         | 6–12                                  |\n| Yes                 | Yes                   | NA                         | 1–2                                   |\n| No                  | Yes                   | NA                         | 1–2                                   |\n| No                  | No                    | NA                         | 3–6                                   |\n\\* IOP = intraocular pressure; NA = not applicable\n\\** Patients with more advanced damage or greater lifetime risk from primary open-angle glaucoma may require more frequent evaluations.

    "query": "Based on your clinical data, I can provide you with specific lifestyle recommendations to help manage your eye condition and prevent further damage. Your diagnosis of **left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma** and **left eye senile cataract** requires particular attention to certain lifestyle factors.\n\n**Key Lifestyle Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Medication Adherence**: While not strictly a \"lifestyle\" change, the most critical step is following your prescribed treatment plan. Your acute angle-closure glaucoma requires careful management to prevent further damage to your optic nerve.\n\n2. **Sleep Position**: Given your shallow anterior chamber (less than 1/3 corneal thickness), you should avoid sleeping flat on your back. Sleeping with your head elevated on pillows can help reduce intraocular pressure during sleep.\n\n3. **Lighting Conditions**: Your symptoms included photophobia (light sensitivity). Use appropriate lighting - avoid very dim or very bright lighting extremes. Consider wearing sunglasses with UV protection when outdoors to reduce glare and discomfort.\n\n4. **Stress Management**: Stress can potentially affect intraocular pressure. Your clinical history mentions poor sleep and appetite during your acute episode. Developing stress-reduction techniques like gentle exercise (with your doctor's approval), meditation, or relaxation exercises may be beneficial.\n\n5. **Hydration Habits**: Drink fluids steadily throughout the day rather than consuming large amounts at once, as rapid fluid intake can temporarily increase intraocular pressure.\n\n6. **Regular Follow-up**: Maintain all scheduled ophthalmology appointments. Your vision measurements (VOD 0.4, VOS 0.1) and intraocular pressure (IOP OD Tn, OS T+2) need regular monitoring.\n\n7. **Avoid Eye Strain**: Given your decreased vision (0.1 in left eye), ensure adequate lighting for reading and close work to minimize strain.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n- **No self-medication**: Your medical history indicates no known drug allergies, but always consult your ophthalmologist before taking any new medications, as some drugs can affect intraocular pressure.\n\n- **Emergency awareness**: Be aware of glaucoma symptoms - sudden eye pain, vision loss, nausea, headache, and halos around lights. If these recur, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n- **Cataract management**: Your senile cataract will need monitoring, and your ophthalmologist will advise on appropriate timing for any surgical intervention.\n\nThese lifestyle adjustments, combined with your medical treatment, can help protect your remaining vision and prevent further damage to your eyes. Always discuss any significant lifestyle changes with your ophthalmologist to ensure they're appropriate for your specific condition.",
