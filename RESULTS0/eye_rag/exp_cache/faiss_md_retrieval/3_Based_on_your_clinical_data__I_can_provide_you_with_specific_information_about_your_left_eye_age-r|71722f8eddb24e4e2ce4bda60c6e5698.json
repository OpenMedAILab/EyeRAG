Studies have found that the degree of IOP reduction is greater with higher preoperative IOP levels and that the benefit may last for several years. A prospective study found that older patients, eyes with shorter axial length, women, and those with glaucoma or pseudoexfoliation were more likely to benefit from this effect.\nWhen a candidate for cataract surgery also has glaucoma, surgical treatment options include cataract and IOL surgery alone, combined cataract and glaucoma surgery, glaucoma surgery after cataract surgery, or cataract surgery after glaucoma surgery. Glaucoma surgical options include trabeculectomy, aqueous shunts, nonpenetrating glaucoma surgery, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, and endocyclophotocoagulation. A Veterans Affairs retrospective cohort study showed that eyes with glaucoma are at increased risk for complications and have more modest visual outcomes after cataract surgery compared with eyes that do not have glaucoma.\nPhacoemulsification combined with trabeculectomy provides good IOP control as well as improved CDVA with the potential benefits of protection against potential postoperative IOP spikes and long-term IOP control with a single operation. However, there are some data suggesting that overall bleb survival rates and long-term IOP control may be diminished in a combined procedure versus a stand-alone trabeculectomy. A 2015\n## Cochrane Systematic Review on Combined Cataract and Glaucoma Surgery\nThe Cochrane Systematic Review examined combined versus cataract surgery alone in patients with glaucoma and concluded that there was low-quality evidence that combined cataract and glaucoma surgery resulted in better IOP control at 1 year compared with cataract surgery alone. *(i.e., Insufficient, Discretionary)* The authors suggested the need for further RCTs to develop evidence-based therapeutic guidelines. In the absence of such guidelines, the decision to perform combined surgery rests with the surgeon and should be based on individual patient circumstances.\nIn the presence of a pre-existing filtering bleb, cataract surgery may diminish the effectiveness of the bleb."

            "content": "## HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARE\nSymptomatic cataract is a surgical disorder. Dietary intake and nutritional supplements have demonstrated minimal effect on the prevention or treatment of cataract.\nMost cataract surgery in the United States is performed by small-incision phacoemulsification with foldable intraocular lens (IOL) implantation on an outpatient basis.\nRefractive cataract surgery, including astigmatism management, intraoperative refractive guidance, and specialty IOL implantation, has the potential to reduce a patient’s dependence on eyeglasses or contact lenses for distance, intermediate, and near vision.\nFemtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) increases the circularity and centration of the capsulorrhexis and the precision of the corneal incisions. It may also reduce the amount of ultrasonic energy required to remove a cataract. However, the technology is not yet cost-effective, and the overall risk profile and refractive outcomes have not been shown to be superior to that of standard phacoemulsification.\nTopical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce the incidence of early postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME), but a long-term benefit has not been demonstrated.\nThere is substantial evidence that intracameral antibiotic administration reduces the risk of postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis. Increasing evidence also suggests that topically applied antibiotics do not add to the benefit of intracameral injection.\nMinimally invasive glaucoma surgery can enhance the intraocular pressure-lowering effects of cataract surgery in some patients with mild to moderate glaucoma.\n## INTRODUCTION\n### DISEASE DEFINITION\nA cataract is a degradation of the optical quality of the crystalline lens that affects vision. Most cataract development is related to aging, and it can occur in one or both eyes.\n### PATIENT POPULATION\nAdults (18 years old and older) with cataracts.\n### CLINICAL OBJECTIVES\n- Identify the presence and characteristics of a cataract.\n- Assess the impact of cataract on a patient’s visual status and function as well as the effect on quality of life.\n- Educate the patient about the natural history of cataract and its impact on vision and functional activity. Explain the benefits and risks of surgery and other treatment alternatives to enable the patient to make an informed decision about treatment options.\n- Explain advantages and disadvantages of intraocular lens (IOL) options, including astigmatic, multifocal, extended depth of focus, accommodating, postoperatively power adjustable, and monovision IOL alternatives, to reduce the patient’s need for spectacles or contact lenses after surgery.\n- Identify any ocular comorbidities, high-risk ocular features, or systemic issues that could impact the performance and outcomes of surgery.\n- Establish criteria for a successful treatment outcome with the patient, including working distance(s) and potential limitations in visual outcome(s).\n- Discuss potential postoperative refractive options, including bilateral emmetropia, bilateral myopia, and monovision, as well as the management of any anisometropia between surgical procedures.\n- Perform cataract surgery when surgery will result in enhanced patient function and when the informed patient elects this option. Timing of surgery should be based on what is mutually agreeable between the patient and surgeon.\n- Perform surgery when indicated for improved visualization and management of coexisting ocular disease, such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy.\n- Provide appropriate postoperative care, visual rehabilitation, and treatment of any complications, such as elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or corneal edema.\n- Improve patient safety by reducing the risk of traffic accidents, falls, and fractures.\n## BACKGROUND\n### PREVALENCE\nCataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. The risk of cataract increases with each decade of life starting around age 40. Cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment among Americans of all studied ethnic and racial backgrounds. In the United States, the number of people with cataract is forecasted to double from 24.4 million to about 50 million by the year 2050.\nThere are several different types of cataracts that can be categorized according to which part of the lens becomes opaque. Each type has its own anatomical location, pathology, and risks for development. The different types can exist separately or in various combinations. Several systems are available to classify and grade lens opacities, but variations in grading systems make it difficult to compare prevalence rates between studies."

            "content": "## Surgical Management\nThe predominant method of cataract surgery in much of the world is sutureless, small-incision phacoemulsification with foldable IOL implantation performed on an outpatient basis. Sutures or sealants are used for incision closure if needed. In randomized clinical trials, phacoemulsification produces better uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and a lower rate of surgical complications, such as iris prolapse and posterior capsule rupture, than manual extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with incision closure by sutures or manual small-incision cataract extraction (MSICS). Phacoemulsification limits the astigmatic changes that occur with larger incisions and enables both astigmatism management and the implantation of specialty IOLs.\nIn economically disadvantaged countries, MSICS remains popular because of its cost-effectiveness, and sutureless ECCE with IOL implantation performed very well compared with phacoemulsification in one randomized clinical trial.\n### Indications for Surgery\nThe primary indication for cataract surgery is a decline in visual function such that it no longer meets a patient’s visual needs and for which surgery provides a reasonable likelihood of improvement. Other indications for cataract removal include the following:\n- There is clinically significant anisometropia in the presence of a cataract.\n- A lens opacity interferes with optimal diagnosis or management of posterior segment pathology.\n- A lens causes inflammation and related secondary glaucoma (phacolytic, lens particle, phacoantigenic).\n- The lens induces primary angle closure or other forms of lens-related glaucoma.\n### Contraindications to Surgery\nSurgery for a cataract should not be performed under the following circumstances:\n## Preoperative Evaluation and Counseling\nThe ophthalmologist who will perform cataract surgery should do the following:\n- Examine the patient preoperatively (see Ophthalmic Evaluation section).\n- Ensure that the documented evaluation accurately reflects the symptoms, findings, and indications for treatment.\n- Obtain informed consent from the patient or the patient’s surrogate decision maker after discussing the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery, including the patient’s expected surgical experience and the anticipated refractive outcome.\n- Review the results of the presurgical evaluation with the patient or the patient’s surrogate decision maker.\n- Counsel the patient about postoperative refractive options, such as bilateral emmetropia, bilateral myopia, or monovision, that will work best given the ophthalmic history and patient’s desires.\n- Counsel the patient about elective refractive options, such as astigmatism management, intraoperative refractive guidance, specialty IOLs (toric, extended depth of focus, multifocal, accommodating, and postoperative power adjustable), and postoperative refractive enhancement.\n- Consider the effect of ocular comorbidities in the cataract care process.\n- Formulate a plan, including preoperative medical management, selection of appropriate anesthesia, surgical approach, concurrent procedures, and IOL design and power.\n- Assess relevant aspects of the patient’s mental and physical status, such as the ability to cooperate and position for surgery.\n- Formulate a postoperative care plan and inform the patient or the patient’s surrogate decision maker of these arrangements (setting of care, care provider).\n- Determine the effect of any concurrent upper-eyelid blepharoptosis. Blepharoptosis can induce corneal astigmatism or make astigmatism more difficult to measure. Additionally, cataract surgery can worsen blepharoptosis.\n- Answer the patient’s questions about the surgery and care, including associated costs.\n- Assess barriers to communication, including language or hearing impairment.\n- Ensure that the patient and the patient’s caregiver, if applicable, are committed and able to attend the postoperative visits and address transportation, medication administration, and other potential challenges.\nIdeally, the operating ophthalmologist should perform the preoperative assessment because this allows the surgeon to formulate a plan and establish a relationship with the patient before surgery. Although the ophthalmologist is responsible for the examination and review of the data, certain aspects of data collection may be conducted by other trained team members under the ophthalmologist’s supervision and within his or her review.\nPatients undergoing cataract surgery frequently have a preoperative medical evaluation, including a history and physical examination that takes into consideration the risk factors for undergoing the planned anesthesia. However, three randomized clinical trials have failed to show that this evaluation reduces systemic or ocular complications and no trials have shown it to be efficacious. For patients with certain severe systemic diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, poorly controlled arterial blood pressure, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, poorly controlled congestive heart failure, or poorly controlled diabetes), additional evaluation and management may be indicated."

    "query": "Based on your clinical data, I can provide you with specific information about your left eye age-related cataract and whether surgery will be required in the future.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nYes, your left eye age-related cataract will likely require surgical intervention in the future. Your clinical records clearly document that you have \"senile cataract\" in your left eye, which is the medical term for age-related cataract. This condition was noted in both your admission and discharge diagnoses.\n\n**Clinical Context:**\nYour recent hospitalization was primarily for \"primary acute angle-closure glaucoma\" in your left eye, which was the urgent condition requiring immediate treatment. However, the cataract was also identified as a significant finding during your examination. The specialty examination specifically noted that your left eye lens was \"turbid\" (cloudy), which is the hallmark characteristic of cataract formation.\n\n**Current Situation:**\nDuring your recent acute glaucoma episode, the immediate priority was managing the dangerously high eye pressure (noted as T+2 in your left eye). The cataract, while present, was not the primary focus of your emergency treatment. The glaucoma was successfully managed during your hospital stay from June 30 to July 5, 2024.\n\n**Future Considerations:**\nCataracts typically progress gradually over time, causing increasing blurriness, glare sensitivity, and reduced vision quality. Since your left eye vision was already measured at 0.1 (which is significantly reduced) during your recent examination, and you experienced \"blurred vision\" as part of your symptoms, the cataract is already affecting your visual function.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. **Regular Follow-up:** You should continue with regular ophthalmology follow-up appointments to monitor both your glaucoma control and cataract progression.\n2. **Timing of Surgery:** Cataract surgery is typically recommended when the cataract significantly interferes with your daily activities, such as reading, driving, or recognizing faces. Given your current vision level of 0.1 in the left eye, you may already be approaching this threshold.\n3. **Combined Management:** Your ophthalmologist will need to carefully coordinate cataract surgery with your glaucoma management, as cataract removal can sometimes affect intraocular pressure control.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nDiscuss the timing of cataract surgery with your ophthalmologist at your next follow-up appointment. They will assess your visual needs, cataract progression rate, and how well your glaucoma is controlled before recommending the optimal timing for surgery.\n\nRemember that cataract surgery is one of the most common and successful surgical procedures performed today, with high rates of vision improvement and patient satisfaction.",
