    "response": "Based on your clinical data and current medical guidelines, I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nThe long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma depends on several factors, including how quickly the condition was treated, the extent of damage already present, and how well your intraocular pressure (IOP) is controlled going forward. With proper management, many patients can maintain functional vision, but the condition requires lifelong monitoring and treatment.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYou experienced a classic acute angle-closure crisis in your left eye with symptoms including sudden distending pain, blurred vision, eye redness, photophobia, tearing, headache, and nausea. Your examination showed significantly elevated IOP (T+2), corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, and lens turbidity. You also have senile cataract in the same eye. This acute episode required hospitalization from June 30 to July 5, 2024, indicating the seriousness of your condition.\n\n**Educational Information About Long-Term Management:**\nAccording to current medical guidelines, after treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma (typically with laser peripheral iridotomy), patients need ongoing monitoring. The follow-up process involves:\n\n1. **Regular gonioscopy** to check for increasing peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) - these are adhesions that can develop between the iris and cornea\n2. **Monitoring for cataract progression**, as lens thickening can contribute to secondary angle closure\n3. **Regular IOP measurements** to ensure pressure remains controlled\n4. **Optic nerve evaluation** to detect any glaucomatous damage\n\nThe guidelines indicate that if IOP remains elevated long-term and you develop primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), ongoing medical therapy to lower IOP will likely become necessary. Your follow-up intervals will depend on your clinical findings and your ophthalmologist's judgment.\n\n**Important Considerations for Your Prognosis:**\n- **Vision preservation**: Untreated acute angle-closure crisis can cause permanent vision loss or blindness, but prompt treatment improves outcomes\n- **Fellow eye risk**: Your right eye is also at high risk of developing acute angle-closure crisis and should be evaluated\n- **Lifelong monitoring**: This is a chronic condition requiring regular follow-up\n- **Medication adherence**: Proper use of eye drops is crucial, especially since research shows patients with visual acuity worse than 20/70 may have more difficulty self-administering medications\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps:**\n1. **Strict adherence** to any prescribed medication regimen\n2. **Regular follow-up appointments** with your ophthalmologist as recommended\n3. **Consider evaluation of family members**, as they may be at increased risk for angle closure\n4. **Be aware of symptoms** that might indicate another acute episode\n5. **Discuss cataract management** with your ophthalmologist, as cataract extraction may help open the angle in some cases\n\nYour prognosis is most favorable with consistent, long-term management and close collaboration with your eye care team. The goal is to preserve your remaining vision and prevent further glaucomatous damage through careful monitoring and appropriate interventions.",

            "content": "## Follow-up Evaluation\nThe recommendations for follow-up evaluations after iridotomy for angle closure apply to ongoing management of PACD and not to visits for other purposes. Following LPI, patients may have an open anterior chamber angle or an anterior chamber angle with a combination of open sectors with areas occluded by PAS. With or without glaucomatous optic neuropathy, patients with a residual open angle or a combination of open angle and some PAS should be followed at appropriate intervals to check for increasing PAS. Special attention should be given to repeat gonioscopy to determine interval changes such as increased extent of PAS or development of secondary angle closure from cataract progression and increased lens thickness. Subsequent follow-up intervals depend on the clinical findings and judgment of the treating ophthalmologist.\nIf IOP remains elevated long term and the patient develops PAC or PACG, then ongoing medical therapy to lower IOP may become necessary. In such a situation, follow-up procedures and intervals would be dictated by the same principles outlined in the Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma PPP. As in primary open-angle glaucoma, adherence to medical therapy may be handicapped when patients run out of medication, due to inadvertent drop wastage or inability to properly instill eyedrops, before they are permitted to refill their prescription. One study found this was more likely for patients who self-administered eyedrop medications when visual acuity was worse than 20/70 in either eye. However, according to a 2010 directive, patients with Medicare insurance may now refill their medication after they have completed at least 70% of the month, or approximately 21 days of therapy.\n## PROVIDER AND SETTING\nThe performance of certain diagnostic procedures (e.g., tonometry, perimetry, pachymetry, anterior segment imaging, optic disc imaging, and photography) may be delegated to appropriately trained and supervised personnel. However, the interpretation of results and medical and surgical management of disease require the medical training, clinical judgment, and experience of the ophthalmologist. Most diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be undertaken safely on an outpatient basis. Hospitalization may be indicated for intensive treatment of an AACC so that patients can be monitored closely after surgical procedures associated with a high risk of serious short-term postoperative complications. It may also be indicated for patients who have experienced surgical complications or for patients who have special medical or social needs.\n## COUNSELING AND REFERRAL\nIf the diagnosis or management of PACD is in question or is refractory to treatment, consultation with or referral to an ophthalmologist with special training or experience in managing these conditions may be indicated. Patients with substantial visual impairment or blindness may benefit from appropriate vision rehabilitation and social services. More information on vision rehabilitation, including materials for patients, is available at [www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision](www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision).\n## SOCIOECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS\nAt the individual patient level, research has demonstrated that glaucomatous vision loss can have a dramatic impact on a patient’s well-being. Patients with glaucoma may struggle with daily activities such as reading, walking, and driving. Performance of these activities deteriorates with worsening of glaucoma severity and when both eyes are affected. Studies have reported that patients with glaucoma are three times more likely to experience falls and six times more likely to be involved in motor vehicle collisions compared with controls. Quality of life is affected for patients with all stages of glaucoma, even those with early disease.\nThe costs of managing a chronic disease like glaucoma can be broken down into direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs. Direct costs include costs of visits to eye care providers, ancillary testing, and medical and surgical interventions. One study estimated that nearly $3 billion USD per year is spent on the direct medical costs for all forms of glaucoma. Direct nonmedical"

            "content": "## Acute Angle-Closure Crisis\nIf the anterior chamber angle is obstructed suddenly, the IOP can rise rapidly to high levels. The characteristic clinical signs and symptoms include pressure-induced corneal edema (experienced as blurred vision and occasionally as halos around lights), a mid-dilated pupil, lens opacities (glaucomflecken), vascular congestion (i.e., conjunctival and episcleral), eye pain, headache, and nausea/vomiting. This condition is considered an AACC and may be self-limited or may recur. Untreated, this entity may cause permanent vision loss or blindness. The fellow eye is also at high risk of AACC.\n## Plateau Iris Configuration and Syndrome\nPlateau iris configuration refers to eyes that have a gonioscopic appearance of the peripheral iris closely apposed to the angle despite a deep central anterior chamber. The etiology, anterior rotation of the ciliary body, can be discerned using dynamic gonioscopy or ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) but not anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT).\nNearly one-third of PAC eyes treated with iridotomy have an angle that retains substantial ITC. On pupil dilation, eyes with plateau iris configuration do not have a substantial increase in IOP. Although no longitudinal study has shown that these eyes have a higher long-term risk to develop PACG than eyes whose angles widen more after iridotomy, the prevalence of plateau iris in one population-based study (8% of occludable angles) compared with that among eyes with PACG (32%–37%) implies that plateau iris does increase the risk of developing PACG. Eyes with plateau iris syndrome may have recurrent high IOP after iridotomy or even after cataract extraction.\n## PATIENT POPULATION\nThe patient population includes individuals of all ages, most of whom are adults older than 50 years with risk factors that include abnormally high transpapillary resistance to aqueous humor movement, most often in association with pupillary block.\n## CLINICAL OBJECTIVES\n- Identify patients who currently have or are at risk of developing PACG or AACC by using gonioscopy\n- Successfully manage AACC\n- Prevent or reverse angle closure by using laser iridotomy, and iridoplasty when indicated. Incisional iridectomy may be required to alleviate pupillary block, in rare cases.\n- Confirm by repeat gonioscopy that the angle is open after intervention. If not open, consider lens extraction or incisional glaucoma surgery when laser and medical therapy does not alleviate IOP elevation.\n- Identify and manage patients with chronic IOP elevation that persists after iridotomy or iridoplasty\n- Evaluate the fellow eye for evidence of angle closure or an anatomically narrow angle in AACC and perform a prophylactic iridotomy when indicated\n- Educate the patient and care giver(s) about the characteristics of the disease and involve them in the patient’s management. Also, encourage the patient to inform genetically related family members that they may be at risk of angle closure and should be evaluated."

            "content": "## INTRODUCTION\n### DISEASE DEFINITION\nPrimary angle-closure disease (PACD) is appositional or synechial closure of the anterior chamber angle. Experts now recognize multiple mechanisms for PACD. Pupillary block is a key element in the pathogenesis of most instances of PACD. The pressure in the posterior chamber is higher than in the anterior chamber due to impairment of aqueous humor flow from the posterior chamber at the pupil, causing an anterior bowing of the iris that crowds the angle in predisposed eyes. Additional mechanisms that contribute to PACD include the relative position and thickness of the ciliary body, the location of the iris insertion into the ciliary body, and the volume of the iris. Certain anatomical features can increase this pressure disparity between the two chambers (e.g., pupil dilation and the crystalline lens size, shape, position, and thickening with age), which then results in iris apposition to the anterior chamber angle structures. In a minority of cases, this can happen acutely, resulting in acute angle-closure crisis (AACC).\nProlonged or repeated contact of the peripheral iris with the trabecular meshwork may lead to functional damage of the trabecular meshwork and the development of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). Primary angle-closure disease may not initially be associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or glaucomatous optic neuropathy, and it may occur in either an acute or chronic form. Secondary forms of angle closure can also occur (e.g., iridocorneal endothelial syndrome, inflammation, or neovascularization). This Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) focuses on PACD, and the management of other secondary forms of angle closure glaucoma (e.g., neovascular glaucoma) is not discussed.\n### DISEASE CLASSIFICATION AND CLINICAL FINDINGS CHARACTERISTIC OF ANGLE CLOSURE\nPrimary angle-closure disease is generally bilateral, although 90% of AACC are unilateral. Patients with PACD and those at risk may be categorized as follows:\n#### TABLE 1: CLINICAL FINDINGS THAT DEFINE PATIENTS SEEN WITH PRIMARY ANGLE-CLOSURE DISEASE\n|                            | Primary Angle-Closure Suspect | Primary Angle Closure | Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|\n| ≥180 degrees ITC          | Present                       | Present               | Present                         |\n| Elevated IOP or PAS       | Absent                        | Present               | Present                         |\n| Optic nerve damage        | Absent                        | Absent                | Present                         |\n**IOP** = intraocular pressure; **ITC** = iridotrabecular contact; **PAS** = peripheral anterior synechiae\n### Primary Angle-Closure Suspect\nIridotrabecular contact (ITC), as observed on gonioscopy without compression, is defined as the iris appearing to touch the anterior chamber angle at the posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork or more anterior structures. The extent of iridotrabecular contact required to diagnose an eye as having PACD has been the subject of debate. Consensus suggests that a person with 180 degrees or more of ITC on dark-room gonioscopy is at risk of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) or an AACC. An eye with this amount or more of ITC, no PAS, and normal IOP is considered a primary angle-closure suspect (PACS). A study conducted in southern India found that about one in four untreated PACS subjects in this population developed elevation in IOP or PAS over 5 years. However, a large prospective population...\n## Primary Angle Closure and Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma\nAny eye that has at least 180 degrees of ITC and an elevated IOP or PAS with no secondary cause for the PAS is classified as having PAC. The presence of high IOP and/or PAS suggests that ITC noted during gonioscopy may cause permanent histopathologic changes to the eye.\nWhen glaucomatous optic neuropathy is present (as defined in the Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma PPP), the eye has progressed from PAC to PACG. Eyes with intermittent PACG may have normal IOP between episodes of elevated IOP that cause optic neuropathy."
