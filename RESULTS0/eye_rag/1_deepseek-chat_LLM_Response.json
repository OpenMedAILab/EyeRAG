    "response": "Based on your clinical data, I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nThe long-term prognosis for primary acute angle-closure glaucoma depends on several factors, including how quickly the condition was treated, the extent of optic nerve damage that occurred during the acute attack, and how well the intraocular pressure (IOP) is controlled going forward. With appropriate treatment and management, many patients can preserve useful vision and prevent further damage.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYou were admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in your left eye for 4 days, which was diagnosed as primary acute angle-closure glaucoma. Your examination showed significantly elevated intraocular pressure in the left eye (T+2), corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, and other signs consistent with an acute angle-closure attack. You also have senile cataract in both eyes.\n\n**Educational Information:**\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma is an ocular emergency where the drainage angle of the eye suddenly becomes blocked, causing a rapid increase in intraocular pressure. This can damage the optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting visual information to your brain. The long-term outlook depends on:\n\n1. **Timeliness of treatment:** You sought treatment within 4 days of symptom onset, which is important for minimizing permanent damage.\n2. **Degree of optic nerve damage:** This is assessed through specialized testing that may not be fully documented in your admission records.\n3. **Ongoing pressure control:** After the acute attack is resolved, you'll need ongoing management to prevent recurrence and further damage.\n4. **Follow-up care:** Regular monitoring of intraocular pressure, optic nerve health, and visual field testing will be essential.\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps:**\n1. **Complete your current treatment:** Follow through with the treatment plan established during your hospitalization.\n2. **Regular follow-up:** You will need regular ophthalmology appointments to monitor your intraocular pressure, optic nerve health, and visual fields.\n3. **Consider preventive treatment:** Your right eye may be at risk for angle-closure glaucoma, so your ophthalmologist will likely discuss preventive measures.\n4. **Cataract management:** Your senile cataracts may need to be addressed, as cataract surgery can sometimes help improve drainage in angle-closure glaucoma.\n5. **Medication adherence:** If prescribed eye drops or other medications, consistent use is crucial for long-term pressure control.\n\nThe goal of treatment is to preserve your remaining vision and prevent further optic nerve damage. With proper management, many patients maintain functional vision and good quality of life. Your specific prognosis will become clearer as your ophthalmologist monitors your response to treatment over time.",

        "DischargeDiagnosis": "1. Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma; 2. Left eye senile cataract",
        "ClinicalHistory": "Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in the left eye for 4 days.\nHistory of Present Illness: Four days ago, the patient experienced sudden onset of distending pain in the left eye without obvious precipitating factors, accompanied by a rapid decrease in vision. Both distant and near vision were unclear, accompanied by irritative symptoms such as eye redness, photophobia, and tearing, as well as ipsilateral headache and nausea. Denied history of ocular trauma. Due to persistent unremitting symptoms, the patient came to our hospital today for treatment. After relevant examinations in the outpatient clinic, the patient was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of \"1. Primary acute angle-closure glaucoma in the left eye; 2. Bilateral pseudophakia.\" During the course of the illness, there was no fever or cough. Appetite and sleep were poor, but bowel movements and urination were normal.\nPast Medical History and Surgical/Trauma History: General condition: Generally healthy. Denied history of chronic diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease; denied history of blood transfusion and trauma. Denied history of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, bacillary dysentery, and typhoid fever. Immunizations were completed on schedule. Denied known allergies to sulfonamides, streptomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, cephalosporins, other medications, or food.\nOphthalmic Examination: Vod 0.4 Vos 0.1. IOP OD Tn OS T+2. Right eye: conjunctiva without hyperemia, cornea clear, peripheral anterior chamber shallow, aqueous humor clear, pupil round, diameter approximately 3mm, light reflex (+), lens turbid, fundus visible with retina attached, no obvious hemorrhage or exudation seen. Left eye: conjunctival mixed hyperemia (++), corneal opacity and edema, subepithelial bullae, KP (-), anterior chamber shallow, peripheral anterior chamber <1/3 CT, aqueous flare (+), pupil round, diameter approximately 4mm, light reflex (+), lens turbid, fundus view obscured.",
        "DifferentialDiagnosis": "1. Acute iridocyclitis: Sudden onset of eye redness, eye pain, varying degrees of vision loss, intraocular pressure often not elevated, significant anterior chamber inflammatory reaction, pupil constricted and irregular in shape.\n2. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis: Patients are mostly young and middle-aged adults, intraocular pressure sharply increases, local irritation symptoms are relatively mild, anterior chamber is not shallow, angle is open, with mutton-fat keratic precipitates on the posterior cornea."
