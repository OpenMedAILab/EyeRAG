    "response": "Based on your clinical information and the available medical literature, I can provide you with specific guidance on lifestyle changes to help prevent further damage to your eyes, particularly in the context of your diagnosis of primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and senile cataract.\n\n**Understanding Your Condition**\n\nYou were diagnosed with left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and senile cataract. This condition involves a sudden increase in eye pressure due to blockage of the eye's drainage system, which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss if not properly managed. The cataract represents clouding of your natural lens. Both conditions require careful management to preserve your vision.\n\n**Lifestyle Recommendations Based on Your Specific Condition:**\n\n1. **Medication Adherence**: While not strictly a \"lifestyle\" change, the most critical step is strict adherence to any prescribed eye drop medications. Glaucoma medications work to lower your eye pressure and prevent further optic nerve damage. Missing doses can lead to pressure spikes and irreversible vision loss.\n\n2. **Regular Follow-up Appointments**: Maintain all scheduled ophthalmology appointments. Your doctor needs to monitor your eye pressure, optic nerve health, and cataract progression. According to medical literature, primary angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, with about 50% of glaucoma-related blindness attributed to this condition.\n\n3. **Avoid Activities That Increase Eye Pressure**: Certain activities can temporarily increase eye pressure and should be approached with caution:\n   - Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise that involves straining\n   - Be cautious with positions that put your head below your heart\n   - Avoid tight clothing around your neck that might restrict blood flow\n\n4. **Eye Protection**: Wear protective eyewear when engaging in activities that could cause eye injury, as trauma can complicate glaucoma management.\n\n5. **Healthy Lifestyle Choices**:\n   - Maintain a balanced diet rich in antioxidants (fruits, vegetables)\n   - Stay hydrated with adequate water intake\n   - Avoid excessive caffeine consumption, which can temporarily increase eye pressure\n   - Don't smoke, as smoking can worsen eye health\n\n6. **Sleep Position**: Some evidence suggests sleeping with your head slightly elevated may help reduce nighttime eye pressure increases.\n\n7. **Stress Management**: Practice stress-reduction techniques, as stress can potentially affect eye pressure. Consider meditation, gentle exercise (with your doctor's approval), or other relaxation methods.\n\n8. **Vision Monitoring**: Pay attention to any changes in your vision, eye pain, redness, or halos around lights, and report these to your ophthalmologist promptly.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nThe medical literature emphasizes that surgical intervention is often necessary for primary angle-closure glaucoma. While lifestyle changes are important adjuncts, they cannot replace medical or surgical treatment. Your condition was severe enough to require hospitalization, indicating the importance of comprehensive medical management.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nContinue working closely with your ophthalmologist. They may discuss surgical options with you, as surgical peripheral iridectomy combined with other procedures is often recommended for primary angle-closure glaucoma, especially when cataract is present. The combination of cataract extraction with glaucoma surgery is a common approach for patients with both conditions.\n\nRemember that glaucoma is a chronic condition requiring lifelong management. Your proactive approach to lifestyle modifications, combined with proper medical care, gives you the best chance of preserving your vision and preventing further damage to your eyes.",

Cautious preoperative screening, personalized and reasonable surgical design and postoperative care should be ensured to achieve satisfactory results. This expert consensus is written by the experts from the Refractive Surgery Group of Chinese Ophthalmologist Association based on the clinical experience and research findings. Selection of indications, methods and significance of the monocular tolerance test, customized surgical design, evaluation of postoperative visual quality and specific nursing are described, with an aim to provide guidance for the clinical standardization of laser corneal refractive surgery in the correction of refractive errors with age‑related accommodation deficiency.
