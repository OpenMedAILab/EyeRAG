    "response": "Based on your clinical data and current medical literature, I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nThe long-term prognosis for primary acute angle-closure glaucoma depends on several factors, including how quickly treatment was initiated, the extent of optic nerve damage at diagnosis, and how well the condition responds to treatment. Primary acute angle-closure glaucoma is considered a serious condition that requires prompt and appropriate management to prevent permanent vision loss.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYou were admitted with sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in your left eye for 4 days, diagnosed with \"Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma\" and \"Left eye senile cataract.\" Your examination showed significantly elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the left eye (T+2), corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, and lens turbidity. These findings are characteristic of an acute angle-closure glaucoma attack.\n\n**Educational Information About Prognosis:**\nAccording to the medical literature, primary angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, with approximately 50% of glaucoma-related blindness attributed to this condition. The key factors affecting your long-term prognosis include:\n\n1. **Timeliness of Treatment:** Acute attacks require emergency treatment to lower intraocular pressure and prevent permanent damage to the optic nerve. Your prompt presentation for treatment is a positive factor.\n\n2. **Extent of Optic Nerve Damage:** The degree of optic nerve damage at the time of diagnosis significantly influences long-term visual outcomes. Since your fundus view was obscured during examination, a detailed assessment of your optic nerve status will be important.\n\n3. **Treatment Approach:** Current expert consensus recommends different surgical approaches based on your specific situation. For cases like yours with both glaucoma and cataract, combined cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation (Phaco+IOL) along with appropriate glaucoma procedures is often recommended.\n\n4. **Ongoing Management:** Even after successful initial treatment, regular monitoring of intraocular pressure and optic nerve health is essential, as some patients may require additional medications or procedures to maintain control.\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps:**\nYour treatment team will likely consider surgical options appropriate for your condition. According to current guidelines, for patients with both angle-closure glaucoma and cataract (like your situation), combined cataract extraction with glaucoma surgery is often recommended. This approach can help open the drainage angle and control intraocular pressure while addressing your cataract.\n\nIt's important to understand that while treatment can effectively control intraocular pressure and prevent further vision loss, any vision already lost due to optic nerve damage may not be recoverable. Regular follow-up appointments, adherence to any prescribed medications, and monitoring for changes in your vision will be crucial for maintaining the best possible long-term outcome.\n\nThe good news is that with appropriate treatment and careful monitoring, many patients with primary acute angle-closure glaucoma can maintain useful vision and prevent further progression of the disease.",
