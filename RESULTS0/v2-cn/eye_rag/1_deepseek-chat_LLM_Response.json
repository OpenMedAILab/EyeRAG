    "response": "Based on your clinical data, I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nThe long-term prognosis for primary acute angle-closure glaucoma depends on several factors, including how quickly treatment was initiated, the extent of optic nerve damage that occurred during the acute attack, and how well the intraocular pressure (IOP) is controlled going forward. With appropriate management, many patients can preserve useful vision and prevent further damage.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYou were admitted with sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in your left eye for 4 days, which is characteristic of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Your examination showed significantly elevated intraocular pressure in the left eye (T+2), corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, and vision reduced to 0.1 in the left eye compared to 0.4 in your right eye. You also have senile cataract in both eyes, which is common at your age.\n\n**Key Factors Affecting Your Prognosis:**\n1. **Timing of Treatment:** You received treatment within 4 days of symptom onset, which is favorable for minimizing permanent damage.\n2. **Initial Vision:** Your left eye vision was 0.1 at presentation, indicating some visual impairment from the acute attack.\n3. **Associated Conditions:** The presence of cataract may complicate management but can be addressed surgically if needed.\n4. **Treatment Response:** How well your eye responds to initial treatment and maintains normal pressure will significantly influence long-term outcomes.\n\n**Educational Information:**\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma is an ocular emergency where the drainage angle of the eye suddenly becomes blocked, causing rapid pressure buildup. The goal of treatment is to:\n- Immediately lower the intraocular pressure to prevent optic nerve damage\n- Create a permanent drainage pathway (usually through laser or surgical procedures)\n- Prevent similar attacks in the other eye\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps:**\n1. **Follow-up Care:** You will need regular monitoring of your intraocular pressure, optic nerve health, and visual fields.\n2. **Preventive Treatment:** Your right eye will likely need preventive treatment (usually laser peripheral iridotomy) since it's at risk for similar attacks.\n3. **Medication Adherence:** If prescribed eye drops, consistent use is crucial for long-term pressure control.\n4. **Cataract Management:** Your cataracts may need surgical intervention in the future, which can sometimes help with glaucoma management as well.\n\nWith proper treatment and regular follow-up, many patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma maintain functional vision and prevent further visual loss. The key is consistent monitoring and adherence to your treatment plan to protect your remaining optic nerve function.",

        "DischargeDiagnosis": "1. Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma; 2. Left eye senile cataract",
        "ClinicalHistory": "Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in the left eye for 4 days.\nHistory of Present Illness: Four days ago, the patient experienced sudden onset of distending pain in the left eye without obvious precipitating factors, accompanied by a rapid decrease in vision. Both distant and near vision were unclear, accompanied by irritative symptoms such as eye redness, photophobia, and tearing, as well as ipsilateral headache and nausea. Denied history of ocular trauma. Due to persistent unremitting symptoms, the patient came to our hospital today for treatment. After relevant examinations in the outpatient clinic, the patient was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of \"1. Primary acute angle-closure glaucoma in the left eye; 2. Bilateral pseudophakia.\" During the course of the illness, there was no fever or cough. Appetite and sleep were poor, but bowel movements and urination were normal.\nPast Medical History and Surgical/Trauma History: General condition: Generally healthy. Denied history of chronic diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease; denied history of blood transfusion and trauma. Denied history of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, bacillary dysentery, and typhoid fever. Immunizations were completed on schedule. Denied known allergies to sulfonamides, streptomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, cephalosporins, other medications, or food.\nOphthalmic Examination: Vod 0.4 Vos 0.1. IOP OD Tn OS T+2. Right eye: conjunctiva without hyperemia, cornea clear, peripheral anterior chamber shallow, aqueous humor clear, pupil round, diameter approximately 3mm, light reflex (+), lens turbid, fundus visible with retina attached, no obvious hemorrhage or exudation seen. Left eye: conjunctival mixed hyperemia (++), corneal opacity and edema, subepithelial bullae, KP (-), anterior chamber shallow, peripheral anterior chamber <1/3 CT, aqueous flare (+), pupil round, diameter approximately 4mm, light reflex (+), lens turbid, fundus view obscured.",
        "DifferentialDiagnosis": "1. Acute iridocyclitis: Sudden onset of eye redness, eye pain, varying degrees of vision loss, intraocular pressure often not elevated, significant anterior chamber inflammatory reaction, pupil constricted and irregular in shape.\n2. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis: Patients are mostly young and middle-aged adults, intraocular pressure sharply increases, local irritation symptoms are relatively mild, anterior chamber is not shallow, angle is open, with mutton-fat keratic precipitates on the posterior cornea."
