    "response": "Based on your clinical data and the available medical literature, I can provide you with specific lifestyle recommendations to help protect your eyes and prevent further damage, particularly given your diagnosis of primary acute angle-closure glaucoma in the left eye.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nFor someone with your condition (acute angle-closure glaucoma and cataract), the most important lifestyle changes focus on protecting your eyes from further pressure spikes, maintaining good eye health, and following your treatment plan diligently.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYou were diagnosed with \"Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma\" and \"Left eye senile cataract.\" Your symptoms included sudden onset of distending pain, blurred vision, eye redness, photophobia, tearing, headache, and nausea. Your intraocular pressure (IOP) was significantly elevated in the left eye (T+2), and you had corneal edema and shallow anterior chamber. This indicates you experienced an acute glaucoma attack, which requires careful management to prevent recurrence and further optic nerve damage.\n\n**Educational Information and Lifestyle Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Medication Adherence:** The most critical \"lifestyle\" change is strict adherence to any prescribed eye drop medications. These medications lower your eye pressure and prevent further damage to your optic nerve. Missing doses can lead to pressure spikes and irreversible vision loss.\n\n2. **Regular Follow-up Appointments:** Consistent follow-up with your ophthalmologist is essential. As noted in the glaucoma guidelines, \"降眼压对于治疗各阶段...均有明确益处\" (lowering intraocular pressure has clear benefits for all stages of treatment). Your doctor needs to monitor your eye pressure, optic nerve health, and visual field regularly.\n\n3. **Avoid Eye Pressure Triggers:** While not specifically mentioned in your provided literature, based on general medical knowledge for angle-closure glaucoma, you should:\n   - Avoid medications that can dilate your pupils (some cold medications, antidepressants, etc.)\n   - Be cautious in dark environments that might cause pupil dilation\n   - Avoid excessive fluid intake at one time\n   - Sleep with your head slightly elevated\n\n4. **General Eye Health Practices:** The guidelines for high myopia provide useful general principles that apply to your situation:\n   - **Follow the 20-20-20 rule:** When doing close work, take a break every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds\n   - **Proper lighting:** Ensure adequate lighting when reading or doing close work\n   - **Maintain good posture:** Keep proper reading distance (at least 1 foot away)\n   - **Limit screen time:** Control your use of electronic devices\n   - **Avoid reading in moving vehicles or in poor lighting conditions**\n\n5. **Overall Health Management:**\n   - **Maintain a healthy lifestyle:** As mentioned in the guidelines, \"保证充足睡眠、劳逸结合、平衡饮食、合理营养\" (ensure adequate sleep, balance work and rest, maintain a balanced diet with proper nutrition)\n   - **Regular exercise:** Engage in appropriate physical activity, but avoid activities that might increase eye pressure (consult your doctor about specific restrictions)\n   - **Manage stress:** Maintain good emotional state as stress can potentially affect eye pressure\n   - **Control systemic conditions:** While you don't have diabetes or hypertension mentioned, if you develop any systemic conditions, their control is important for eye health\n\n6. **Protective Measures:** Avoid activities that involve sudden head movements or positions that might increase eye pressure. The guidelines caution against \"眼部碰撞和激烈运动\" (eye collisions and intense exercise) for certain eye conditions.\n\n**Important Next Steps:**\n1. Discuss these recommendations with your ophthalmologist to tailor them to your specific situation\n2. Ask about any specific restrictions regarding exercise, medications, or activities\n3. Ensure you understand your medication schedule completely\n4. Report any new symptoms immediately (eye pain, vision changes, redness, halos around lights)\n\nRemember that glaucoma is a chronic condition requiring lifelong management. The combination of proper medical treatment and healthy lifestyle habits offers the best protection for your remaining vision. Your proactive approach to asking about lifestyle changes is an excellent first step in managing your eye health effectively.",
