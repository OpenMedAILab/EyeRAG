    "response": "Based on your clinical data and the current medical literature, I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nThe long-term prognosis for primary acute angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) depends on several factors including how quickly treatment was initiated, the extent of optic nerve damage at diagnosis, and how well the intraocular pressure is controlled over time. According to the medical literature, glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with approximately 50% of glaucoma-related blindness attributed to PACG. China has a particularly high prevalence and blindness rate of PACG, accounting for about 50% of global PACG cases.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYou were diagnosed with \"Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma\" and \"Left eye senile cataract\" at age 79. Your symptoms included sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in the left eye for 4 days, accompanied by eye redness, photophobia, tearing, headache, and nausea. Your intraocular pressure was significantly elevated (T+2 in the left eye), and examination showed corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, and lens turbidity. These findings are consistent with an acute angle-closure glaucoma episode.\n\n**Educational Information:**\nPrimary acute angle-closure glaucoma is a special type of PACG classified by its onset characteristics. The condition involves pathological changes in the uveal tract (iris-ciliary body-choroid complex), which plays a crucial role in the development and progression of PACG. When the pupil dilates, the iris becomes more convex, reducing iris volume. Changes in the ciliary muscle can alter lens thickness and zonules, further shallowing the anterior chamber. Increased choroidal thickness can push the iris-lens diaphragm forward, leading to changes in the anterior chamber and angle.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis Factors:**\nSurgery is the first-line treatment for PACG. The goal of treatment is to:\n1. Relieve the acute angle closure\n2. Control intraocular pressure\n3. Prevent further optic nerve damage\n4. Preserve remaining vision\n\nThe prognosis improves with:\n- Prompt diagnosis and treatment (which you received)\n- Successful surgical intervention to open the drainage angle\n- Good intraocular pressure control post-operatively\n- Regular follow-up monitoring\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps:**\n1. **Adherence to Treatment:** Follow your ophthalmologist's recommendations for any prescribed medications or post-operative care\n2. **Regular Monitoring:** Attend all scheduled follow-up appointments to monitor intraocular pressure and optic nerve health\n3. **Contralateral Eye Protection:** Since you have bilateral pseudophakia (artificial lenses in both eyes), your right eye also needs monitoring as PACG can affect both eyes\n4. **Symptom Awareness:** Be aware of symptoms that might indicate another episode (eye pain, redness, vision changes, headache, nausea)\n\nWhile glaucoma is a chronic, potentially sight-threatening condition, with proper management including surgical intervention and ongoing care, many patients maintain functional vision long-term. The key to preserving vision is controlling intraocular pressure to prevent further damage to the optic nerve. Your prompt presentation for treatment was crucial in minimizing potential damage from this acute episode.",
