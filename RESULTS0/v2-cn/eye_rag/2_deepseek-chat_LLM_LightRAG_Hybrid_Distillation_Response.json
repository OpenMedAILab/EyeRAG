    "response": "Based on your clinical information and current medical guidelines, I can provide you with specific lifestyle recommendations to help prevent further damage to your eyes, particularly given your diagnosis of left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and senile cataract.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nYou should focus on several key lifestyle modifications to protect your eyes from further damage. The most critical aspect is preventing acute glaucoma attacks, which can cause rapid and irreversible vision loss.\n\n**Specific Lifestyle Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Medication Caution:** You must be extremely careful with certain medications. Avoid antihistamines (common in cold and allergy medicines) and any cycloplegic agents (medications that dilate pupils), as these can trigger angle-closure glaucoma attacks. Always inform any healthcare provider about your glaucoma diagnosis before taking new medications.\n\n2. **Avoid Pupil Dilation:** Since pupil dilation is a known risk factor for glaucoma attacks, you should avoid situations that cause your pupils to dilate excessively. This includes being in very dark environments for prolonged periods and using medications that cause mydriasis (pupil dilation).\n\n3. **Eye Protection:** Protect your eyes from mechanical trauma and chemical exposures. Eye injuries can worsen glaucoma and cause additional optic nerve damage. Wear protective eyewear during activities that could risk eye injury.\n\n4. **Regular Monitoring:** Maintain consistent follow-up with your ophthalmologist. Regular monitoring of your intraocular pressure, visual field examinations, and optic nerve assessments are crucial for detecting any progression of your glaucoma. You should also have regular anterior chamber angle examinations to monitor the status of your angle closure.\n\n5. **Recognize Emergency Symptoms:** Be vigilant about the symptoms of an acute glaucoma attack, which include sudden eye pain, blurred vision, eye redness, halos around lights, nausea, and headache. If you experience these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention, as prompt treatment is essential to prevent permanent vision loss.\n\n6. **Systemic Health Management:** While your medical history doesn't indicate diabetes or hypertension, it's important to manage any systemic health conditions well, as these can affect your eye health and treatment options.\n\n7. **Surgical Considerations:** Given that you have both glaucoma and cataract, you should discuss with your ophthalmologist whether combined surgical approaches (such as cataract extraction with glaucoma surgery) might be beneficial for you. Transparent lens extraction is sometimes recommended as a first-line treatment for angle-closure glaucoma in patients with cataracts.\n\n**General Eye Health Practices:**\nWhile not specifically mentioned for glaucoma, maintaining overall healthy lifestyle habits can benefit your ocular health. This includes proper hydration, a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, and managing any dry eye symptoms you might experience, as dry eye can affect surgical outcomes if you need procedures in the future.\n\n**Important Note:** During an acute glaucoma attack, compound pilocarpine injection is contraindicated, so it's crucial that emergency medical providers are aware of your specific condition.\n\nYour current situation requires careful management, but with proper lifestyle adjustments and regular medical follow-up, you can help protect your remaining vision and prevent further damage to your eyes.",

Increasing evidence shows that MIGS also plays an increasingly important role in the treatment of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). Surgical peripheral iridectomy (SPI) plus goniosynechialysis (GSL) and goniotomy (GT), as a new procedure, has been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of PACG with no or mild cataracts. However, there is still a lack of uniform standards for indications, surgical procedures, and perioperative medication. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a detailed and complete expert recommendations on surgical procedures to standardize the application of combined  $\\\\mathrm{SPI} + \\\\mathrm{GSL} + \\\\mathrm{GT}$  in the treatment. Some experts in glaucoma treatment and management in China have discussed the current problems and developing trend in MIGS for PACG and put forward the expert recommendations of standard process, including indications, anaesthetic methods, surgical site, operating procedure and rational administration of drugs in perioperation, in order to standardize the medical process of clinicians using combined  $\\\\mathrm{SPI} + \\\\mathrm{GSL} + \\\\mathrm{GT}$  in PACG treatment and lay a foundation for better evaluation of the efficacy of MIGS.\\n\\n[Key words] Primary angle-closure glaucoma; Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery; Surgical peripheral iridectomy; Goniosynechialysis; Goniotomy; Expert recommendation DOI:10.3760/cma.j.cn115989-20221127-00552\\n\\n青光眼是全球首位不可逆性致盲眼病，其致盲患者中约  $50\\\\%$  是原发性闭角型青光眼（primaryangle-closure glaucoma，PACG）。我国PACG患病率及致盲率均较高，全球约  $50\\\\%$  的PACG病例在我国[1-2]。手术是PACG的一线治疗方法，既往针对合并透明晶状体或没有白内障手术指征的中晚期PACG的首选手术方案是小梁切除术[3-4]，但小梁切除术并发症较多，如创口较大、浅前房、持续性低眼压、角膜内皮失代偿、眼内炎、恶性青光眼以及滤过泡相关并发症等[5]，也存在医师学习曲线长、术后需要长期的精细处理等问题。因此，临床工作中对于一些特殊情况，如年轻、具有恶性青光眼特征的PACG患者，既往通常采用虹膜周边切除术(surgical peripheral iridectomy，SPI)联合术后降眼压药物替代治疗[6-8]。\\n\\n微创青光眼手术（minimally invasive glaucoma surgery, MIGS)近年来在临床上得到广泛开展。SPI联合房角分离（goniosynechialysis, GSL）及房角切开术（goniotomy, GT）（同内路 Schlemm 切开术，ab internotrabeculotomy）作为一种新型的微创青光眼联合术式，通过 SPI 解除瞳孔阻滞，沟通前后房；GSL 分离前粘连的虹膜，重新开放房角；GT 切开病变小梁网组织，增加房水外流从而降低眼压[9]。已有临床研究和临床实践表明其适用于合并透明晶状体或没有白内障手术指征的中晚期 PACG 的治疗[10-13]。由于其手术操作简单、快捷、并发症少，有望替代小梁切除术并成为此类患者的优选手术方式。然而，随着  $\\\\mathrm{SPI} + \\\\mathrm{GSL} + \\\\mathrm{GT}$  手术的广泛开展，其手术操作、围手术期用药仍缺乏统一的规范。因此，制定一个完整详细的手术操作规范，为临床医生的相关实践提供专家指导意见非常有必要。为了规范 SPI 联合 GSL 及 GT 的治疗方法，国内部分青光眼治疗专家共同讨论并对目前相关治疗方法中存在的问题进行分析，提出 SPI 联合 GSL 及 GT 治疗 PACG 专家推荐意见。\", \"file_path\": \"./medical_guide_markdown/周边虹膜切除联合房角分离及房角切开术操作规范专家推荐意见 .md\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"content\": \"# 中国干眼专家共识:生活方式相关性干眼 (2022年)\\n\\n亚洲干眼协会中国分会 海峡两岸医药卫生交流协会眼科学专业委员会眼表与泪液病学组 中国医师协会眼科医师分会眼表与干眼学组\\n\\n通信作者：刘祖国，厦门大学附属翔安医院眼科及厦门眼科中心厦门大学眼科研究所福建省眼科与视觉科学重点实验室福建省眼再生医学工程研究中心，厦门361102，Email:zuguoliu@xmu.edu.cn\\n\\n【摘要】流行病学研究结果证实干眼的发病与人群的生活方式密切相关。《中国干眼专家共识：定义和分类(2020年)》将生活方式相关因素纳入到干眼的发病原因和危险因素中。为了提高对生活方式相关性干眼的认识以及诊疗和预防效果，亚洲干眼协会中国分会等学术组织的相关专家根据我国的国情和民情，结合国内外研究进展，并汇集国内专家的临床经验，在其定义和分类、发病机制、临床特点、诊断、治疗原则及预防等方面形成共识性意见，以期为临床开展相关工作提供参考。\\n\\n【关键词】 干眼综合征；生活方式； 诊疗准则(主题)； 多数赞同\\n\\nChinese expert consensus on dry eye: lifestyle-related dry eye (2022)\\n\\nChinese Branch of the Asian Dry Eye Society, Ocular Surface and Tear Film Diseases Group of Ophthalmology Committee of Cross-Straits Medicine Exchange Association, Ocular Surface and Dry Eye Group of Chinese Ophthalmologist Association\\n\\nCorresponding author: Liu Zuguo, Department of Ophthalmology, Xiang'an Hospital and Xiamen Eye Center affiliated to Xiamen University, Eye Institute of Xiamen University, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Fujian Engineering and Research Center of Eye Regenerative Medicine, Xiamen 361102, China, Email: zuguoliu@xmu.edu.cn\\n\\n【Abstract】Epidemiological studies have confirmed that the incidence of dry eye is closely related to lifestyles.

This consensus can be used as a reference for clinical work.\\n\\n【Key words】 Dry eye syndromes; Life style; Practice guidelines as topic; Consensus\\n\\n干眼是多因素导致的慢性眼表疾病。大量的流行病学研究结果证实，干眼的发生与人群的生活方式密切相关。2020年《中国干眼专家共识：定义和分类(2020年)》提出了3种干眼的分类方法，在按发病原因和危险因素分类中，生活方式相关因素\\n\\n性为干眼的一种类型。在临床工作中，针对干眼患者的生活方式进行细致的病史采集和评估，一方面有助于找到干眼的发病原因或危险因素，进行病因学诊断，从而采取针对性治疗；另一方面有利于对患者进行健康生活方式的宣传教育和患者的慢性疾病\\n\\n自我管理、自我预防。鉴于此，亚洲干眼协会中国分会、海峡两岸医药卫生交流协会眼科学专业委员会眼表与泪液病学组以及中国医师协会眼科医师分会眼表与干眼学组，根据我国的国情和民情，结合国内外研究进展，并汇集国内专家的临床经验，对生活方式相关性干眼的定义和分类、发病机制、临床特点、诊断、治疗原则及预防等形成共识性意见，以期为临床开展相关工作提供参考。\\n\\n## 一、定义\\n\\n生活方式相关性干眼是指由各类长期不良生活方式引起的干眼。在调整生活方式后，患者的症状或体征通常能得到一定程度的改善甚至消失。\\n\\n## 二、分类\\n\\n根据发病原因和危险因素可将生活方式相关性干眼分为3类。\\n\\n1. 与生活行为相关：主要包括长时间使用视频显示终端、睡眠不足或睡眠质量差（如长期熬夜等）、长期戴角膜接触镜、不良眼部化妆习惯、吸烟、无防护的户外活动、长时间驾驶等导致的干眼。\\n2. 与室内环境相关：主要包括长时间在供暖或空调制冷环境内工作或生活导致的干眼。（在《中国干眼专家共识：定义和分类(2020年)》[1]中，空气污染、气候变化等大环境因素导致的干眼属于环境因素性干眼）\\n3. 与饮食相关：主要包括缺乏营养的低质量饮食、高脂饮食、过量饮酒等导致的干眼。\", \"file_path\": \"./medical_guide_markdown/中国干眼专家共识：生活方式相关性干眼（2022年） .md\"}, {\"id\": 3, \"content\": \"# 中国年龄相关性黄斑变性临床诊疗指南（2023 年）\\n\\n中华医学会眼科学分会眼底病学组 中国医师协会眼科医师分会眼底病学组通信作者：许迅，上海交通大学医学院附属第一人民医院眼科 国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心 上海市眼底病重点实验室 上海眼视觉与光医学工程技术研究中心 上海市眼科疾病精准诊疗工程技术研究中心，上海 200080，Email：drxuxun@tom.com\\n\\n【摘要】　年龄相关性黄斑变性（ ）是老年人群低视力乃至失明的主要原因，随着我国人口老龄化加剧，AMD的患病人数将持续上升。近10年，眼底影像学检查技术飞速发展，为AMD的分型、诊断和随访提供了新的视角和途径，新药的开发为 尤其新生血管性 提供了更为多样的干预和治疗方法，而强调精准个体化治疗对眼底病医师提出了更高要求。为此，中华医学会眼科学分会眼底病学组、中国医师协会眼科医师分会眼底病学组与国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心基于最新循证医学证据，结合国际指南和我国社会经济发展现状，围绕 个临床问题提出推荐意见，形成了我国的临床诊疗指南，以期加强和完善我国 诊疗工作的规范化，提高我国 的诊疗、预防和随访水平。（本文于2023年4月6日优先出版在中华眼科杂志官网）\\n\\n【关键词】　黄斑变性；　诊疗准则（主题）；　循证医学实践指南注册：国际实践指南注册与透明化平台，IPGPR‑2021CN111\\n\\nEvidence‑based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of age‑related macular degeneration in China (2023)\\n\\nChinese Vitreo‑Retina Society of Chinese Medical Association, Fundus Disease Group of Chinese Ophthalmologist Association\\n\\nCorresponding author: Xu Xun, Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Eye Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Ocular Fundus Diseases, Shanghai Engineering Center for Visual Science and Photomedicine, Shanghai Engineering Center for Precise Diagnosis and Treatment of Eye Diseases, Shanghai 200080, China, Email: drxuxun@tom.com\\n\\n【Abstract】 Age‑related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of low vision and even blindness in the elderly. With the aging of our population, the number of AMD patients will continue to rise. In the past decade, the rapid development of ocular fundus imaging technology has provided a new perspective and approach for the classification, diagnosis and follow‑up of AMD. The advent of new drugs has provided more diverse intervention and treatment methods for AMD, especially for neovascular AMD, and the emphasis on accurate and individualized treatment has put forward higher requirements for retinal specialists. Therefore, based on the latest evidence‑based medical information, combined with the international guidelines and the current situation of China′s social and economic development, experts from the Chinese Vitreo‑Retinal Society of Chinese Medical Association, the Fundus Disease Group of Chinese Ophthalmologist Association, and the\\n\\nNational Clinical Research Center for Eye Diseases gave recommendations around eight clinical problems and formed China′s guidelines for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of AMD. With the implementation of these guidelines, we can standardize the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and follow‑up of AMD in China.
