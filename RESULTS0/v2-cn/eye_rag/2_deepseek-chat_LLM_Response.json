    "response": "Based on your clinical data, I can provide you with specific lifestyle recommendations to help manage your eye condition and prevent further damage. You were diagnosed with **left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma** and **left eye senile cataract**, which require careful management.\n\n**Key Lifestyle Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Medication Adherence**: While not a lifestyle change per se, this is the most critical aspect of preventing further damage. You must take all prescribed glaucoma medications exactly as directed to control your intraocular pressure (IOP). Missing doses can lead to pressure spikes that damage your optic nerve.\n\n2. **Regular Follow-up Appointments**: Your condition requires close monitoring. Attend all scheduled ophthalmology appointments for IOP checks, visual field testing, and optic nerve evaluation. These appointments are essential for detecting any progression early.\n\n3. **Avoid Triggers for Angle Closure**: Since you have angle-closure glaucoma, you should:\n   - Avoid medications that can dilate your pupils (like certain cold medicines, antidepressants, or motion sickness drugs)\n   - Inform all healthcare providers about your glaucoma diagnosis before taking any new medications\n   - Be cautious with dim lighting conditions that might cause pupil dilation\n\n4. **Eye Protection**: Wear protective eyewear during activities that could cause eye trauma, as injury could worsen your glaucoma or cataract.\n\n5. **Healthy Lifestyle Habits**:\n   - Maintain a balanced diet rich in antioxidants (fruits, vegetables)\n   - Stay hydrated but avoid drinking large amounts of fluid at once, as this can temporarily increase eye pressure\n   - Engage in regular, moderate exercise (with your doctor's approval), as this may help lower IOP\n   - Avoid inverted yoga positions or head-down positions that could increase eye pressure\n\n6. **Smoking Cessation**: If you smoke, quitting is crucial as smoking can worsen eye conditions and interfere with healing.\n\n7. **Stress Management**: Since stress can potentially affect eye pressure, practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or gentle walks.\n\n8. **Proper Lighting**: Ensure adequate lighting when reading or doing close work to reduce eye strain.\n\n**Important Note**: Your acute angle-closure glaucoma episode required hospitalization, indicating this is a serious condition. The most critical preventive measure is strict adherence to your treatment plan and regular monitoring by your ophthalmologist. Any sudden return of symptoms like eye pain, redness, blurred vision, halos around lights, nausea, or headache requires immediate medical attention.\n\nThese lifestyle adjustments, combined with your medical treatment, will help protect your remaining vision and prevent further damage to your eyes.",

        "ClinicalHistory": "Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in the left eye for 4 days.\nHistory of Present Illness: Four days ago, the patient experienced sudden onset of distending pain in the left eye without obvious precipitating factors, accompanied by a rapid decrease in vision. Both distant and near vision were unclear, accompanied by irritative symptoms such as eye redness, photophobia, and tearing, as well as ipsilateral headache and nausea. Denies history of ocular trauma. As symptoms persisted without relief, the patient came to our hospital today for treatment. After relevant examinations in the outpatient clinic, the patient was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of \"1. Left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma; 2. Bilateral pseudophakia.\" During the course of the illness, there was no fever or cough. Appetite and sleep were poor, but bowel movements and urination were normal.\nPast Medical History and Surgical/Trauma History: General condition: Usually in general good health. Denies history of chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease; denies history of blood transfusion or trauma. Denies history of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, bacillary dysentery, and typhoid fever. Immunizations completed on schedule. Denies allergies to sulfonamide drugs, streptomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, cephalosporins, other medications, or any known food allergies.\nOphthalmic Examination: Vod 0.4, Vos 0.1. IOP OD Tn, OS T+2. Right eye: conjunctiva without hyperemia, cornea clear, peripheral anterior chamber shallow, aqueous humor clear, pupil round with a diameter of approximately 3mm, reactive to light (+), lens turbid, fundus visible with retina attached, no obvious hemorrhage or exudation seen. Left eye: conjunctival mixed hyperemia (++), corneal opacity and edema, subepithelial bullae, KP (-), anterior chamber shallow, peripheral anterior chamber <1/3 CT, aqueous flare (+), pupil round with a diameter of approximately 4mm, reactive to light (+), lens turbid, fundus not visible.",
        "DifferentialDiagnosis": "1. Acute iridocyclitis: Sudden onset of eye redness, eye pain, varying degrees of vision loss, intraocular pressure usually not elevated, significant anterior chamber inflammatory reaction, pupil constricted and irregular in shape.\n2. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis: Patients are mostly young and middle-aged adults, acute sharp increase in intraocular pressure, local irritation symptoms are mild, anterior chamber is not shallow, open angle, mutton-fat KPs on the posterior cornea."
