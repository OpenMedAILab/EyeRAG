    "response": "Based on your clinical information and the available medical literature, I can provide you with specific guidance on lifestyle changes to help prevent further damage to your eyes.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question**\n\nAs someone diagnosed with left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and senile cataract, there are several important lifestyle adjustments you should consider to protect your vision and prevent further damage. While the medical literature doesn't provide specific lifestyle recommendations for your exact combination of conditions, it does indicate that \"lifestyle adjustment is a strategy for preventing low vision\" and that modifying habits may help slow the progression of vision impairment.\n\n**Key Lifestyle Recommendations Based on Your Condition:**\n\n1. **Regular Eye Examinations Are Essential**: Given that glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and you have both glaucoma and cataract, regular follow-up appointments are crucial. The literature emphasizes that \"glaucoma patients require specific follow-up management to monitor disease progression.\" You should adhere strictly to your ophthalmologist's recommended follow-up schedule, which will likely include regular intraocular pressure measurements, visual field testing, and anterior chamber angle examinations.\n\n2. **Be Cautious with Medications**: The literature specifically warns that \"glaucoma may be caused by steroid-induced intraocular pressure elevation\" and that \"long-term use of steroid eye preparations may lead to glaucoma.\" Therefore, you should avoid using steroid-containing eye drops without explicit approval from your ophthalmologist. Additionally, \"low-concentration atropine eye drops are contraindicated in glaucoma patients,\" so you should inform all healthcare providers about your glaucoma diagnosis before starting any new eye medications.\n\n3. **Avoid Certain Vision Correction Methods**: The literature indicates that \"glaucoma is a contraindication for wearing orthokeratology lenses\" and that \"glaucoma patients should be cautious when wearing orthokeratology lenses.\" This suggests you should avoid certain types of contact lenses and discuss any vision correction options carefully with your eye care provider.\n\n4. **Consider Environmental Factors**: While not specific to glaucoma, the literature on lifestyle-related dry eye suggests avoiding prolonged exposure to heating or air-conditioned environments, which may help maintain overall eye comfort and health.\n\n5. **Maintain Healthy Eye Habits**: The literature emphasizes that \"health education helps patients adopt and maintain healthier eye habits.\" This includes proper lighting when reading, taking regular breaks during close work, and protecting your eyes from injury.\n\n6. **Nutritional Considerations**: Although not directly mentioned for glaucoma, the literature notes that \"lifestyle adjustments are recommended as a treatment strategy to improve dry eye symptoms\" and mentions that \"poor quality diet, high-fat diet, and excessive alcohol consumption\" can contribute to eye problems. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in antioxidants may support overall eye health.\n\n**Important Context from Your Clinical Situation:**\n\nYou've recently been hospitalized for acute angle-closure glaucoma, which is a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention. The fact that you experienced sudden onset of eye pain, blurred vision, redness, photophobia, and nausea indicates you had a significant intraocular pressure spike. This experience underscores why preventive measures are so important.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- **Follow Your Treatment Plan**: Continue any prescribed medications exactly as directed to control your intraocular pressure.\n- **Attend All Follow-up Appointments**: Regular monitoring of your intraocular pressure, visual fields, and anterior chamber angles is essential.\n- **Communicate Symptoms Promptly**: If you experience any recurrence of eye pain, vision changes, or other concerning symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.\n- **Discuss Surgical Options**: The literature indicates that \"surgery is the first-line treatment for PACG,\" and you may need to discuss potential surgical interventions with your ophthalmologist to better control your condition long-term.\n\nRemember that while lifestyle changes can support your eye health, they do not replace medical treatment for glaucoma. Your condition requires ongoing professional management to prevent further vision loss. The combination of proper medical care and healthy lifestyle habits offers the best approach to preserving your vision.",

zhangxl2@mail.sysu.edu.cn\\n\\n[Abstract] Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) has been successfully incorporated in clinical practice in recent years. Increasing evidence shows that MIGS also plays an increasingly important role in the treatment of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). Surgical peripheral iridectomy (SPI) plus goniosynechialysis (GSL) and goniotomy (GT), as a new procedure, has been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of PACG with no or mild cataracts. However, there is still a lack of uniform standards for indications, surgical procedures, and perioperative medication. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a detailed and complete expert recommendations on surgical procedures to standardize the application of combined  $\\\\mathrm{SPI} + \\\\mathrm{GSL} + \\\\mathrm{GT}$  in the treatment. Some experts in glaucoma treatment and management in China have discussed the current problems and developing trend in MIGS for PACG and put forward the expert recommendations of standard process, including indications, anaesthetic methods, surgical site, operating procedure and rational administration of drugs in perioperation, in order to standardize the medical process of clinicians using combined  $\\\\mathrm{SPI} + \\\\mathrm{GSL} + \\\\mathrm{GT}$  in PACG treatment and lay a foundation for better evaluation of the efficacy of MIGS.\\n\\n[Key words] Primary angle-closure glaucoma; Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery; Surgical peripheral iridectomy; Goniosynechialysis; Goniotomy; Expert recommendation DOI:10.3760/cma.j.cn115989-20221127-00552\\n\\n青光眼是全球首位不可逆性致盲眼病，其致盲患者中约  $50\\\\%$  是原发性闭角型青光眼（primaryangle-closure glaucoma，PACG）。我国PACG患病率及致盲率均较高，全球约  $50\\\\%$  的PACG病例在我国[1-2]。手术是PACG的一线治疗方法，既往针对合并透明晶状体或没有白内障手术指征的中晚期PACG的首选手术方案是小梁切除术[3-4]，但小梁切除术并发症较多，如创口较大、浅前房、持续性低眼压、角膜内皮失代偿、眼内炎、恶性青光眼以及滤过泡相关并发症等[5]，也存在医师学习曲线长、术后需要长期的精细处理等问题。因此，临床工作中对于一些特殊情况，如年轻、具有恶性青光眼特征的PACG患者，既往通常采用虹膜周边切除术(surgical peripheral iridectomy，SPI)联合术后降眼压药物替代治疗[6-8]。\\n\\n微创青光眼手术（minimally invasive glaucoma surgery, MIGS)近年来在临床上得到广泛开展。SPI联合房角分离（goniosynechialysis, GSL）及房角切开术（goniotomy, GT）（同内路 Schlemm 切开术，ab internotrabeculotomy）作为一种新型的微创青光眼联合术式，通过 SPI 解除瞳孔阻滞，沟通前后房；GSL 分离前粘连的虹膜，重新开放房角；GT 切开病变小梁网组织，增加房水外流从而降低眼压[9]。已有临床研究和临床实践表明其适用于合并透明晶状体或没有白内障手术指征的中晚期 PACG 的治疗[10-13]。由于其手术操作简单、快捷、并发症少，有望替代小梁切除术并成为此类患者的优选手术方式。然而，随着  $\\\\mathrm{SPI} + \\\\mathrm{GSL} + \\\\mathrm{GT}$  手术的广泛开展，其手术操作、围手术期用药仍缺乏统一的规范。因此，制定一个完整详细的手术操作规范，为临床医生的相关实践提供专家指导意见非常有必要。为了规范 SPI 联合 GSL 及 GT 的治疗方法，国内部分青光眼治疗专家共同讨论并对目前相关治疗方法中存在的问题进行分析，提出 SPI 联合 GSL 及 GT 治疗 PACG 专家推荐意见。\", \"file_path\": \"./medical_guide_markdown/周边虹膜切除联合房角分离及房角切开术操作规范专家推荐意见 .md\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"content\": \"# 中国假性剥脱综合征眼病临床诊疗专家共识 (2025)\\n\\n《中国假性剥脱综合征眼病临床诊疗专家共识(2025)》专家组\\n\\n通信作者：丁琳，Email:dinglin85600@163.com；吴开力，Email:wukaili@mail.sysu.edu.cn\\n\\n丁琳，新疆维吾尔自治区人民医院，乌鲁木齐830001；吴开力，中山大学中山眼科中心，广州510060\\n\\n【摘要】假性剥脱综合征(PEX)是一种全身性、与年龄相关、多因素参与的细胞外基质代谢紊乱性疾病，其主要特征为剥脱物质的异常产生并在眼部及全身各种内脏器官的结缔组织中蓄积，是世界范围内常见的继发青光眼和/或白内障的原因之一。PEX的早期症状不明显，加之临床医师和患者对该疾病的认识不足，因此极易造成误诊或漏诊，造成患者视力的不可逆损害，影响患者的视觉和生活质量。目前，国内外对PEX的诊断和治疗尚缺乏统一的、规范的流程和方案，对该病的有效诊治及疗效评估带来很大挑战。因此我们组织相关领域的临床诊疗专家成立《中国假性剥脱综合征眼病临床诊疗专家共识(2025)》专家组，采用改良德尔菲法广泛收集和整理全国范围内眼科医生在PEX诊断和治疗中面临的主要问题，在充分回顾国内外相关研究文献的基础上，结合本专家组成员的临床经验，就PEX的流行病学、危险因素、发病机制、诊断与鉴别诊断、治疗方案和随访管理等进行反复讨论和修订，最终形成专家共识，对PEX的规范诊疗提出专家推荐意见，以指导和规范临床眼科医生PEX的诊治方法。\\n\\n【关键词】 假性剥脱综合征；诊断；治疗；青光眼；白内障；专家共识\\n\\n实践指南注册：国际实践指南注册与透明化平台（PREPARE-2025CN599）\\n\\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn115989-20250120-00018\\n\\nChinese expert consensus on the diagnosis and management of eye pseudoexfoliation syndrome (2025)\\n\\nExpert workgroup of Chinese expert consensus on the diagnosis and management of eye pseudoexfoliation syndrome (2025)\\n\\nCorresponding authors: Ding Lin, Email: dinglin85600@163.com; Wu Kaili, Email: wukaili@mail.sysu.edu.cn\\n\\nDing Lin, People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Urumchi 830001, China; Wu Kaili, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Guangzhou 510060, China\\n\\n[Abstract] Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) is a systemic, age-related, multi-factor disorder of extracellular matrix metabolism characterized by the abnormal production and progressive accumulation of fibrillar pseudoexfoliative material in ocular tissues and multiple systemic organs. Globally recognized as a leading cause of secondary glaucoma and cataract formation, PEX often presents with subtle or nonspecific early clinical manifestations. This insidious onset often leads to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis due to insufficient awareness among clinicians and patients, ultimately contributing to irreversible vision loss and diminished quality of life. Currently, the lack of globally standardized diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for PEX hampers its effective clinical management. To address these challenges, we employed a modified Delphi consensus methodology to systematically identify critical issues encountered by ophthalmologists in the management of PEX. Based on a comprehensive review of the international literature and incorporating clinical insights from experts, we conducted rigorous multidisciplinary deliberations on key aspects of PEX, including its epidemiology, risk factors, molecular pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, evidence-based treatment strategies, and long-term follow-up protocols. This collaborative effort culminated in an evidence-driven expert consensus aimed at standardizing clinical practice and improving patient outcomes in the treatment of PEX.\\n\\n[Key words] Pseudoexfoliation syndrome; Diagnosis; Treatment; Glaucoma; Cataract; Expert consensus\\n\\nPractice guideline registration: Practice Guideline Registration for Transparency (PREPARE-2025CN599)\\n\\nDOI:10.3760/cma.j.cn115989-20250120-00018\", \"file_path\": \"./medical_guide_markdown/中国假性剥脱综合征眼病临床诊疗专家共识(2025) .md\"}, {\"id\": 3, \"content\": \"# 中国干眼专家共识:生活方式相关性干眼 (2022年)\\n\\n亚洲干眼协会中国分会 海峡两岸医药卫生交流协会眼科学专业委员会眼表与泪液病学组 中国医师协会眼科医师分会眼表与干眼学组\\n\\n通信作者：刘祖国，厦门大学附属翔安医院眼科及厦门眼科中心厦门大学眼科研究所福建省眼科与视觉科学重点实验室福建省眼再生医学工程研究中心，厦门361102，Email:zuguoliu@xmu.edu.cn\\n\\n【摘要】流行病学研究结果证实干眼的发病与人群的生活方式密切相关。《中国干眼专家共识：定义和分类(2020年)》将生活方式相关因素纳入到干眼的发病原因和危险因素中。为了提高对生活方式相关性干眼的认识以及诊疗和预防效果，亚洲干眼协会中国分会等学术组织的相关专家根据我国的国情和民情，结合国内外研究进展，并汇集国内专家的临床经验，在其定义和分类、发病机制、临床特点、诊断、治疗原则及预防等方面形成共识性意见，以期为临床开展相关工作提供参考。\\n\\n【关键词】 干眼综合征；生活方式； 诊疗准则(主题)； 多数赞同\\n\\nChinese expert consensus on dry eye: lifestyle-related dry eye (2022)\\n\\nChinese Branch of the Asian Dry Eye Society, Ocular Surface and Tear Film Diseases Group of Ophthalmology Committee of Cross-Straits Medicine Exchange Association, Ocular Surface and Dry Eye Group of Chinese Ophthalmologist Association\\n\\nCorresponding author: Liu Zuguo, Department of Ophthalmology, Xiang'an Hospital and Xiamen Eye Center affiliated to Xiamen University, Eye Institute of Xiamen University, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Fujian Engineering and Research Center of Eye Regenerative Medicine, Xiamen 361102, China, Email: zuguoliu@xmu.edu.cn\\n\\n【Abstract】Epidemiological studies have confirmed that the incidence of dry eye is closely related to lifestyles.
