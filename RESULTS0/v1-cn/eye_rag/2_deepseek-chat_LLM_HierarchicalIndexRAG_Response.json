    "response": "Based on your clinical information and current medical guidelines, I can provide you with specific lifestyle recommendations to help prevent further damage to your eyes, particularly given your diagnosis of left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and senile cataract.\n\n**Understanding Your Condition**\nYou were diagnosed with acute angle-closure glaucoma in your left eye, which is characterized by sudden increases in eye pressure that can damage the optic nerve. This condition requires careful management to prevent vision loss. The medical literature emphasizes that glaucoma is a chronic progressive eye disease where most patients need long-term or even lifelong medications and management strategies.\n\n**Key Lifestyle Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Medication Adherence is Critical**: Since you'll likely need long-term glaucoma medications, it's essential to use them exactly as prescribed. The 2022 Chinese expert consensus on glaucoma medications highlights that proper adherence to treatment is crucial for controlling glaucoma progression and preventing further damage. Missing doses can lead to uncontrolled eye pressure and optic nerve damage.\n\n2. **Regular Follow-up Appointments**: Given that glaucoma requires lifelong monitoring, maintaining regular appointments with your ophthalmologist is essential. They will monitor your eye pressure, optic nerve health, and visual field to detect any progression early.\n\n3. **Eye Protection**: While not specifically mentioned in the provided literature, protecting your eyes from trauma is generally recommended for all glaucoma patients to prevent additional damage.\n\n4. **Healthy Lifestyle Choices**: Although the specific literature provided doesn't detail lifestyle modifications, general ophthalmological practice recommends:\n   - Maintaining a healthy blood pressure\n   - Avoiding activities that might dramatically increase eye pressure (like heavy lifting or straining)\n   - Staying hydrated but avoiding excessive fluid intake at one time\n   - Managing stress, which can sometimes affect eye pressure\n\n5. **Surgical Considerations**: The literature indicates that for certain types of angle-closure glaucoma, surgical interventions like cataract removal (Phaco+IOL) may be recommended to widen the drainage angle. Since you have both glaucoma and cataract, discussing surgical options with your ophthalmologist could be important for long-term management.\n\n**Important Note About Your Specific Case**\nYour examination showed significant inflammation and pressure elevation in your left eye. The acute nature of your condition means that immediate medical management was crucial, and now ongoing management will be essential to prevent recurrence and further damage.\n\n**Next Steps**\nI recommend discussing these points with your ophthalmologist:\n- Your specific medication regimen and how to optimize adherence\n- The frequency of follow-up visits needed for your condition\n- Whether surgical intervention (like cataract removal) might be beneficial for your glaucoma management\n- Any specific activity restrictions you should follow\n\nRemember that glaucoma management is a partnership between you and your eye care team. By being proactive about your treatment and follow-up care, you can help preserve your remaining vision and prevent further damage to your eyes.",

The ocular surface diseases caused by the use of topical glaucoma medications seriously affect the treatment compliance, the quality of life, and the treatment effects. In order to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of topical glaucoma medications‑related ocular surface diseases, to improve the ocular surface health of patients and to effectively control the progress of glaucoma, the Glaucoma Group of Ophthalmology Branch of Chinese Medical Association has formulated this consensus after serious consideration and discussion. This evidence‑based consensus puts forward suggestions on the characteristics, occurrence mechanism, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and follow‑up of ocular surface diseases associated with topical glaucoma medications.\n\n【Key words】 Glaucoma; Drug therapy; Eye diseases; Practice guidelines as topic; Consensus\n\n2020年欧洲青光眼指南指出青光眼治疗的目标是在具有可持续性的医疗保健系统中提高患者的幸福感以及生活质量［1］ 。青光眼患者需要终生用药，然而长期使用抗青光眼药物易引起或加重原有的眼表疾病，降低患者的治疗依从性，进而影响对青光眼疾病进展的控制效果和患者的生活质量。"
