    "response": "Based on your clinical data and the current medical literature, I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nThe long-term prognosis for primary acute angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) depends on several factors, including how quickly the condition was diagnosed and treated, the extent of optic nerve damage at presentation, and how well the intraocular pressure is controlled after treatment. Since you received prompt medical attention (within 4 days of symptom onset) and were hospitalized for treatment, this is a positive factor for your prognosis.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYou presented with classic symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma in your left eye: sudden onset of distending pain, blurred vision, eye redness, photophobia, tearing, headache, and nausea. Your examination showed significantly elevated intraocular pressure (T+2), corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, and lens turbidity. You also have senile cataract in the same eye. Your right eye examination showed normal intraocular pressure but shallow peripheral anterior chamber, which indicates you may be at risk for angle-closure in that eye as well.\n\n**Educational Information About PACG Prognosis:**\nAccording to the medical literature, primary angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, with approximately 50% of PACG cases worldwide occurring in China. The key to preserving vision in PACG is early diagnosis and appropriate treatment to prevent further optic nerve damage.\n\nThe 2019 Chinese Expert Consensus on PACG diagnosis and treatment notes that recent research has advanced our understanding of PACG mechanisms. The condition involves complex interactions between the iris, ciliary body, and choroid (collectively called the uvea), which all contribute to angle closure. Genetic factors also play a role in PACG development.\n\n**Treatment Considerations and Long-Term Management:**\nFor patients like you with both PACG and cataract, the 2021 Chinese Expert Consensus on combined cataract and primary glaucoma surgery recommends phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation (Phaco+IOL) to widen the anterior chamber angle. This approach addresses both conditions simultaneously and can help prevent future angle-closure episodes.\n\nAfter surgery, it's crucial to monitor your peripheral anterior chamber depth. If the chamber doesn't deepen sufficiently after cataract surgery, additional evaluation with ultrasound biomicroscopy may be needed to assess ciliary body position and other non-pupillary block factors.\n\n**Recommendations for Your Long-Term Care:**\n1. **Regular Follow-up:** You will need lifelong monitoring of your intraocular pressure, optic nerve health, and visual fields, even after successful treatment.\n2. **Both Eyes Need Attention:** Since your right eye shows shallow anterior chamber, you should discuss preventive measures with your ophthalmologist to reduce the risk of angle-closure in that eye.\n3. **Medication Adherence:** If prescribed eye drops to control intraocular pressure, consistent use is essential for preserving vision.\n4. **Recognize Warning Signs:** Be aware of symptoms that might indicate another acute episode (severe eye pain, blurred vision, halos around lights, headache, nausea) and seek immediate medical attention if they occur.\n\nWhile acute angle-closure glaucoma is a serious condition that can cause permanent vision loss if untreated, prompt medical intervention like you received significantly improves the chances of preserving useful vision. The combination of appropriate surgical treatment and diligent long-term follow-up gives you the best opportunity to maintain your vision and quality of life.",
