    "response": "Based on your clinical information and the available medical literature, I can provide you with specific guidance on lifestyle changes to help prevent further damage to your eyes, particularly given your diagnosis of primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and senile cataract.\n\n**Understanding Your Condition**\n\nYou were diagnosed with left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and senile cataract. Acute angle-closure glaucoma occurs when the drainage angle in your eye becomes blocked, causing a rapid increase in eye pressure that can damage the optic nerve. This is different from the more common open-angle glaucoma that develops slowly over time.\n\n**Lifestyle Recommendations Based on Your Condition**\n\n1. **Medication Adherence**: While not strictly a \"lifestyle\" change, the most critical step is strict adherence to any prescribed eye drop medications. These medications help control your eye pressure and prevent further optic nerve damage. Missing doses can lead to pressure spikes and irreversible vision loss.\n\n2. **Regular Follow-up Appointments**: Maintain all scheduled follow-up visits with your ophthalmologist. Regular monitoring of your eye pressure and optic nerve health is essential for preventing further damage.\n\n3. **Avoid Triggers for Angle Closure**: Certain activities and medications can trigger angle-closure attacks:\n   - **Medication Awareness**: Inform all healthcare providers about your glaucoma diagnosis before taking any new medications, as some drugs (like certain cold medicines, antidepressants, or motion sickness medications) can dilate your pupils and trigger angle closure.\n   - **Lighting Conditions**: Avoid sudden transitions from bright to dark environments, as pupil dilation in dim light can precipitate angle closure.\n   - **Emotional Stress**: Try to manage stress through relaxation techniques, as emotional stress can sometimes trigger acute attacks.\n\n4. **Sleep Position**: Some evidence suggests that sleeping with your head elevated may help reduce nighttime eye pressure. Consider using an extra pillow.\n\n5. **Exercise Considerations**: Regular, moderate exercise can be beneficial for overall eye health, but avoid exercises that involve head-down positions (like certain yoga poses) which can increase eye pressure. Consult with your ophthalmologist about appropriate exercise routines.\n\n6. **Nutrition**: While no specific diet cures glaucoma, maintaining a healthy diet rich in antioxidants (leafy greens, colorful fruits and vegetables) supports overall eye health. Some evidence suggests omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial.\n\n7. **Smoking Cessation**: If you smoke, quitting is strongly recommended as smoking can worsen vascular health and potentially affect glaucoma progression.\n\n8. **Caffeine Moderation**: Limit caffeine intake, as excessive consumption can temporarily increase eye pressure in some individuals.\n\n9. **Eye Protection**: Wear protective eyewear during activities that could cause eye trauma, as injury can complicate glaucoma management.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\nThe medical literature emphasizes that primary angle-closure glaucoma requires surgical intervention as a first-line treatment. According to the expert recommendations, \"手术是PACG的一线治疗方法\" (surgery is the first-line treatment for PACG). Your treatment plan likely includes or will include surgical options to create a new drainage pathway and prevent future acute attacks.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nYour most important lifestyle change is becoming an active participant in your eye care. Keep a record of your symptoms, medication schedule, and any questions for your doctor. Since you have both glaucoma and cataract, your treatment plan may involve combined surgical approaches, as mentioned in the consensus documents about managing glaucoma with coexisting cataract.\n\nRemember that while lifestyle changes can support your eye health, they do not replace medical treatment. The surgical interventions recommended for your condition are designed to prevent further damage by addressing the underlying anatomical issues causing your glaucoma.\n\nWould you like me to clarify any of these recommendations or discuss specific aspects of your treatment plan further?",

Cautious preoperative screening, personalized and reasonable surgical design and postoperative care should be ensured to achieve satisfactory results. This expert consensus is written by the experts from the Refractive Surgery Group of Chinese Ophthalmologist Association based on the clinical experience and research findings. Selection of indications, methods and significance of the monocular tolerance test, customized surgical design, evaluation of postoperative visual quality and specific nursing are described, with an aim to provide guidance for the clinical standardization of laser corneal refractive surgery in the correction of refractive errors with age‑related accommodation deficiency.
