    "response": "Based on your clinical data and the current medical literature on primary acute angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye condition.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nThe long-term prognosis for primary acute angle-closure glaucoma depends on several factors, including how quickly the acute attack was treated, the extent of optic nerve damage that occurred during the attack, and how well your intraocular pressure (IOP) is controlled going forward. With prompt treatment and proper management, many patients can preserve useful vision and prevent further damage.\n\n**Relevant Context from Your Clinical Data:**\nYou experienced a sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in your left eye for 4 days, which is characteristic of an acute angle-closure glaucoma attack. Your examination showed significantly elevated intraocular pressure (T+2), corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, and other signs consistent with this diagnosis. The fact that you sought treatment promptly is a positive factor for your prognosis.\n\n**Educational Information About PACG:**\nAccording to the 2019 Chinese Expert Consensus on Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Diagnosis and Treatment, acute angle-closure glaucoma is a special type of PACG classified by its onset characteristics. The consensus notes that recent research has advanced our understanding of PACG, revealing that its development is related to pathological and physiological changes in the uveal tract (iris-ciliary body-choroid complex).\n\n**Key Factors Affecting Your Prognosis:**\n\n1. **Timeliness of Treatment:** You received treatment within 4 days of symptom onset, which is crucial for minimizing permanent damage to your optic nerve.\n\n2. **Optic Nerve Status:** The extent of damage to your optic nerve during the acute attack will significantly influence your long-term visual prognosis. This requires careful monitoring through regular eye examinations.\n\n3. **Ongoing Management:** Successful long-term prognosis depends on maintaining controlled intraocular pressure through medications, laser treatment, or surgery as recommended by your ophthalmologist.\n\n4. **Regular Follow-up:** You will need lifelong monitoring to ensure your intraocular pressure remains within safe limits and to detect any progression of glaucoma damage.\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps:**\n1. **Adhere Strictly** to any prescribed medications to control your eye pressure\n2. **Attend All Follow-up Appointments** for regular monitoring of your intraocular pressure, optic nerve health, and visual field\n3. **Be Aware of Warning Signs** such as sudden eye pain, redness, blurred vision, or halos around lights, and seek immediate medical attention if these occur\n4. **Consider Genetic Factors** - while not directly mentioned in your history, recent research shows genetic components may influence PACG development\n\nThe goal of treatment is to prevent further optic nerve damage and preserve your remaining vision. With proper management and regular monitoring, many patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma maintain functional vision and good quality of life long-term.",
