    "response": "Based on your clinical data and the available medical literature, I can provide you with information about the long-term prognosis for your left eye primary acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n**Direct Answer to Your Question:**\nPrimary acute angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is considered a serious condition that requires prompt and appropriate treatment. According to the medical literature, glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and approximately 50% of glaucoma-related blindness cases are due to primary angle-closure glaucoma. This highlights the importance of proper management for your condition.\n\n**Your Specific Clinical Situation:**\nYou were admitted with sudden onset of distending pain and blurred vision in your left eye for 4 days, accompanied by symptoms like eye redness, photophobia, tearing, headache, and nausea. Your examination showed significantly elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the left eye (T+2), corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, and other signs consistent with acute angle-closure glaucoma. You also have senile cataract in both eyes.\n\n**Treatment and Prognosis Factors:**\nThe medical literature indicates that surgery is the first-line treatment for PACG. For patients like you who have both glaucoma and cataract, the consensus recommends considering combined cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation (Phaco+IOL) to widen the angle. This approach can be particularly effective for angle-closure glaucoma cases where the angle is narrow but not yet extensively scarred.\n\n**Long-Term Outlook:**\nThe long-term prognosis for your left eye depends on several factors:\n1. **Timeliness of treatment:** You sought treatment within 4 days of symptom onset, which is important for minimizing permanent damage.\n2. **Extent of angle damage:** Your clinical data mentions \"peripheral anterior chamber <1/3 CT,\" indicating significant angle narrowing.\n3. **Response to treatment:** How well your eye responds to surgical intervention will significantly impact long-term outcomes.\n4. **Ongoing management:** Glaucoma typically requires lifelong monitoring and possibly continued treatment to control intraocular pressure.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\nWhile the medical literature emphasizes that glaucoma can lead to irreversible vision loss if not properly managed, appropriate surgical intervention combined with careful postoperative care can help preserve your remaining vision. The goal of treatment is to prevent further optic nerve damage and maintain your current level of vision.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nYou should follow your ophthalmologist's recommendations closely regarding surgical intervention and postoperative care. Regular follow-up appointments will be essential to monitor your intraocular pressure, optic nerve health, and visual function over time. Adherence to any prescribed medications and lifestyle recommendations will also play a crucial role in your long-term prognosis.\n\nRemember that while glaucoma is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management, many patients with properly treated angle-closure glaucoma maintain functional vision for many years with appropriate care and monitoring.",
