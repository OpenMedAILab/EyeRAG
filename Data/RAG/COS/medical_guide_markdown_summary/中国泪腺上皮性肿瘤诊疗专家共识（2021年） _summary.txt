The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Epithelial Tumors of the Lacrimal Gland" (2021) provides guidelines on the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of lacrimal gland tumors, which represent about 10% of orbital tumors. Epithelial tumors constitute 20-50% of these, with 55% being benign (primarily pleomorphic adenomas) and 45% malignant (mainly adenoid cystic carcinomas). The consensus highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis through clinical evaluation and imaging, and emphasizes complete surgical excision to reduce recurrence. It also addresses the management of recurrent tumors, differentiating between benign and malignant cases, and underscores the need for careful follow-up and potential adjuvant therapies for malignant tumors, which have a poor prognosis.
