The "2024 Guidelines for the Application of Artificial Intelligence in Retinal Fluid Monitoring" is a document created by experts in ophthalmology in China, addressing the rise of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), particularly neovascular AMD (nAMD). It highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance diagnosis and treatment by enabling precise assessments of retinal fluid through optical coherence tomography (OCT). The guidelines discuss AI techniques, such as deep learning models, and stress the need for high-quality medical datasets. While acknowledging challenges like data standardization and interpretability, the document concludes that AI integration can transform patient management in ophthalmology, leading to better treatment outcomes and personalized care.
