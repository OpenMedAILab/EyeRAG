The "Expert Consensus on Correcting Corneal Irregular Astigmatism (2024)" provides guidelines for managing corneal irregular astigmatism, characterized by abnormal corneal shapes that cause uneven refractive power. Developed by the China Eye Valley Rose K Clinical Research Committee, it categorizes the condition by its causes, such as keratoconus and post-surgical changes. The consensus highlights the limitations of traditional glasses and advocates for specialized contact lenses, including rigid gas permeable and custom soft lenses, to enhance visual acuity. It also outlines the fitting process, necessary pre-fitting examinations, and ongoing monitoring for patient safety and comfort, offering evidence-based recommendations for ophthalmologists and optometrists.
