The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma (PACG) in China" (2019) presents updated classifications, diagnostic methods, and treatment principles for PACG, which is characterized by increased intraocular pressure due to angle closure. It introduces a revised classification system with five types of PACG based on angle closure mechanisms and highlights the role of the iris-ciliary body-choroid complex and genetic factors in the disease's pathogenesis. The consensus recommends laser or surgical peripheral iridotomy as the first-line treatment for patients with angle closure and elevated pressure, while emphasizing the need for localized clinical research before implementing international treatment protocols, especially regarding lens extraction surgery. The document aims to provide evidence-based guidance for clinicians managing PACG in China.
