The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diabetic Optic Neuropathy (DON) 2022" highlights the importance of early recognition and management of DON, a common diabetic complication affecting the optic nerve. It categorizes DON into three types: latent DON, diabetic papillopathy, and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, each with unique features. The consensus stresses controlling blood sugar and risk factors, and outlines treatment options such as corticosteroids and neuroprotective agents. It calls for greater awareness and research to improve early detection and treatment, aiming to preserve visual function in diabetic patients.
