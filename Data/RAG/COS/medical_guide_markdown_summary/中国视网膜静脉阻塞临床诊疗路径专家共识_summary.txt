The "Expert Consensus on Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Path of Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) in China," developed by the Fundus Diseases Group of the Chinese Medical Association, aims to standardize the diagnosis and management of RVO, a common condition that can cause significant vision loss and is linked to cardiovascular diseases. It outlines a comprehensive framework that includes definitions, classifications, treatment pathways, and follow-up care, emphasizing individualized treatment plans based on patient-specific factors. The consensus promotes evidence-based practices tailored to China's healthcare context, advocating for regular follow-ups, early intervention, and a multidisciplinary approach to address underlying systemic conditions associated with RVO.
