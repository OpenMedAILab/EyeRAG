The "Standard Surgical Procedure of Penetrating Canaloplasty" (2020) provides guidelines for a glaucoma surgery that avoids filtering blebs, reducing complications associated with traditional methods. Developed by the Glaucoma Collaborative Group, this procedure facilitates direct communication between the anterior chamber and Schlemm's canal, making it applicable for both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma. The document outlines surgical steps, including preoperative preparation, anesthesia, and techniques for creating scleral flaps and accessing Schlemm's canal, aiming to standardize the procedure and enhance patient outcomes in challenging glaucoma cases.
