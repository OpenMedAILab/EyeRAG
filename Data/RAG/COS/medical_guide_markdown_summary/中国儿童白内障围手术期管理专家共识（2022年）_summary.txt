The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Perioperative Management of Cataracts in Children (2022)" provides guidelines for pediatric cataract surgery, focusing on the unique needs of children. Developed by the Chinese Cataract and Refractive Surgery Society, it covers surgical timing, techniques, medication, and visual rehabilitation. The consensus emphasizes early intervention to prevent visual impairment, outlines preoperative evaluations and postoperative care, and stresses the importance of long-term follow-up and parental communication. Its goal is to standardize and enhance the management of pediatric cataracts in clinical practice.
