The "Expert Consensus on Quality Management of Perioperative Anesthesia in Day Surgery," published in the *Chinese Journal of Hospital Administration* in October 2024, presents 22 recommendations from a National Health Commission expert group to enhance anesthesia management in day surgery. It emphasizes anesthesiologists' roles throughout the process and covers key areas such as management mechanisms, standardized protocols, and information system integration. The consensus aims to uphold high standards in day surgery across China, focusing on preoperative assessments, anesthesia techniques, postoperative care, and follow-up, and is based on the Delphi method to align with national regulations.
