The "Guidelines for Image Acquisition and Interpretation of Diabetic Retinopathy Screening in China (2017)" emphasize the critical need for screening diabetic retinopathy (DR), a major cause of blindness in China, where around 270 million people have diabetes. The guidelines advocate for dual-field fundus photography to improve DR detection and set standards for image quality and grading of DR severity. They provide referral criteria based on DR severity and visual acuity, while addressing common challenges in image acquisition and interpretation. The overall goal is to standardize screening practices and enhance patient outcomes through timely interventions.
