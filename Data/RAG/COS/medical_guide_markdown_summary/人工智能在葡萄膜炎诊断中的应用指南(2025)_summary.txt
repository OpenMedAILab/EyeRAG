The "2025 Guidelines for the Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Diagnosis of Uveitis," developed by international and Chinese medical experts, emphasize AI's potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and decision-making in managing uveitis, an eye inflammatory condition with complex causes. The guidelines recommend using AI algorithms, particularly machine learning, for diagnosing and classifying uveitis, while addressing challenges like data representation and the need for high-quality datasets. Future research should focus on validating AI technologies against standard treatments and assessing their impact on clinical outcomes, highlighting AI's promising role in enhancing uveitis diagnosis and treatment.
