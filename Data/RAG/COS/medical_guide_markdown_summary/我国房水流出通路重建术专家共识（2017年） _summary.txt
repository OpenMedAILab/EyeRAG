The "Expert Consensus on Aqueous Outflow Pathway Reconstruction Surgery" (2017) by the Glaucoma Group of the Chinese Medical Association introduces a new surgical technique for treating open-angle glaucoma, called Aqueous Outflow Pathway Reconstruction (RAOD). This method aims to reduce intraocular pressure without the complications associated with traditional trabeculectomy, which relies on filtering blebs. The consensus outlines the indications and contraindications for the procedure and provides a detailed surgical protocol, highlighting the importance of technique for safety and efficacy.
