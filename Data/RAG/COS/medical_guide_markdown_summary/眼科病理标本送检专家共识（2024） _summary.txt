The "Expert Consensus on Submission of Ocular Pathological Specimens (2024)" emphasizes the vital role of pathological diagnosis in ophthalmology for accurate disease identification, treatment planning, and prognosis. Developed by various Chinese ophthalmological groups, it calls for standardized submission protocols for ocular specimens to improve submission rates and reduce missed diagnoses, especially in tumors. Key points include the necessity of submitting all specimens with detailed documentation, guidelines for specimen handling and examination, prioritization of urgent cases, and the need for enhanced training and resources in ocular pathology. The consensus aims to improve diagnostic quality and efficiency, ultimately benefiting patient care and advancing ophthalmology in China.
