The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Dry Eye Treatment (2020)" provides updated guidelines for managing dry eye disease in China, emphasizing a comprehensive and individualized approach. It categorizes treatment into three areas: 

1. **Etiological Treatment**: Identifying and addressing specific causes of dry eye.
2. **Pharmacological Treatment**: Utilizing artificial tears, medications, and anti-inflammatory agents tailored to severity.
3. **Non-Pharmacological Treatment**: Implementing physical therapies and supportive measures.

The consensus also stresses the importance of patient education and a multidisciplinary approach to improve care standards for dry eye in China.
