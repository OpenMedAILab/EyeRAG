The "Expert Consensus on Diagnosis and Treatment of Choroideremia (2024)" provides guidelines for managing choroideremia (CHM), a rare X-linked retinal degeneration affecting primarily males, leading to night blindness and vision loss. Female carriers may show mild symptoms and play a key role in diagnosis and genetic counseling. Developed by the Chinese Hereditary Ocular Disease groups, the consensus aims to standardize diagnostic and management practices for clinicians. While understanding of CHM's molecular mechanisms has improved, effective treatments are still lacking. The document stresses the need for regular assessments, patient education, and genetic counseling, and notes ongoing gene therapy trials as a potential future treatment option.
