The document by Zhang Guo-Ming, Li Na, and Zhang Fu-Yan presents guidelines for screening retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and neonatal eye diseases in China. It highlights the critical need for early screening and treatment of high-risk preterm infants, utilizing advanced technologies like RetCam and anti-VEGF injections. Despite advancements, inconsistent practices in ROP screening and treatment remain, prompting calls for improved protocols and training for healthcare providers. The guidelines also stress the importance of screening full-term newborns for congenital eye diseases and advocate for a systematic approach to enhance early intervention. The authors urge for increased awareness, government support, and standardized protocols to improve neonatal eye care, ultimately benefiting public health and child development.
