The 2016 expert consensus from the Chinese Ophthalmological Society on selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) highlights its development, indications, and operational guidelines for treating primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT). Introduced in 1998, SLT is a safe alternative to argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) and is suitable for various glaucoma types, excluding inflammatory forms. Treatment parameters involve fixed spot size and pulse duration, with energy levels adjusted based on tissue response. Efficacy studies indicate an intraocular pressure reduction of 4.4 to 7.7 mmHg, influenced by pre-treatment pressure and post-treatment medications. The protocol includes pre-treatment assessments, energy adjustments during the procedure, and specific post-operative care, with follow-ups recommended at 1 hour, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, allowing for retreatment if needed.
