In 2018, the Glaucoma Group of the Chinese Medical Association and the Ophthalmology Branch of the Chinese Physician Association proposed expert recommendations to standardize terminology in glaucoma diagnosis and treatment. This initiative, supported by Beijing GaoShi Medical Information Technology Co., aims to improve clinical accuracy and data analysis by enhancing information sharing and semantic interoperability. However, further efforts are needed to encourage clinicians to adopt these standardized terms in practice.
