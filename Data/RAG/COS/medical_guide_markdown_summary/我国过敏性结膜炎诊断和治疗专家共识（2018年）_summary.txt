The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Allergic Conjunctivitis in China (2018)" advocates for standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols for allergic conjunctivitis, which has traditionally depended on individual clinical experience. It categorizes the condition into five subtypes: seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC). Key symptoms include itching, foreign body sensation, and conjunctival hyperemia, with diagnosis involving symptom assessment and laboratory tests. Treatment emphasizes allergen avoidance, symptom relief, and inflammation control using antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants, while highlighting the need for individualized plans and cautioning against unnecessary antibiotic use.
