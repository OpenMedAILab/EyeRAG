The expert consensus on intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) underscores the need for standardized treatment protocols to ensure the safety and effectiveness of care for premature infants. It outlines the indications, contraindications, and procedural requirements for anti-VEGF therapy, noting that these injections can match the efficacy of traditional laser treatments while minimizing the risk of permanent retinal damage. However, careful patient selection is vital due to potential risks, such as fibrous proliferation. The consensus discusses available anti-VEGF drugs, like bevacizumab and ranibizumab, and emphasizes that experienced ophthalmologists should perform the injections in suitable medical settings, with thorough pre-treatment assessments and post-treatment monitoring to manage complications.
