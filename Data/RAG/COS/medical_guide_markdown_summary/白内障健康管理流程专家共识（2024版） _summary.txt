The "Expert Consensus on the Health Management Process of Cataracts (2024)" was created by the Visual Rehabilitation Professional Committee of the Chinese Association of Rehabilitation Medicine to establish comprehensive guidelines for cataract management in China. It aims to standardize practices in risk prediction, early screening, preoperative management, personalized surgical strategies, and postoperative rehabilitation, particularly for patients with comorbidities like diabetes and glaucoma. The consensus is informed by clinical experience, research, and international best practices, and will be updated as new evidence arises. Key focus areas include risk factors, detection methods, assessments, surgical indications, and postoperative care, with an emphasis on public awareness and self-management.
