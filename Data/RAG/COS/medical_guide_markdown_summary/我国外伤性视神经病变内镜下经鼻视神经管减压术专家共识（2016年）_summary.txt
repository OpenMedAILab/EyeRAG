The 2016 expert consensus on endoscopic transnasal optic canal decompression (ETOCD) for traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) in China addresses the rising incidence of TON, mainly due to traffic accidents, which often leads to severe vision loss. Current treatments, including corticosteroids, are largely ineffective. ETOCD is highlighted for its minimally invasive approach, though challenges like inconsistent indications and potential complications persist. The consensus emphasizes the need for early intervention, outlines treatment principles, and recommends ETOCD for patients with significant vision loss, particularly with optic canal fractures. It calls for improved surgical techniques, standardized training, and further research to confirm ETOCD's effectiveness.
