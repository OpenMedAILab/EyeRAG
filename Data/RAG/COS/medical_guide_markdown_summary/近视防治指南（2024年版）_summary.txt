The "Myopia Prevention and Control Guidelines (2024 Edition)" address the increasing prevalence of myopia in China, especially among children and adolescents, recognizing it as a major public health concern. The guidelines define myopia, categorize it by refractive components and severity, and outline diagnostic criteria. Key contributing factors include environmental influences like excessive near work and lack of outdoor activity, as well as genetic predisposition. Regular eye exams are recommended from infancy for early detection and management. Correction methods include glasses, contact lenses, and low-concentration atropine drops, with surgical options for older patients. The guidelines stress the need for monitoring pathological myopia to prevent severe complications and advocate for a comprehensive approach to prevention and control through education and regular check-ups.
