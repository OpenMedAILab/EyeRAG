The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (Papilledema) in China (2025)" outlines the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH), which is marked by increased intracranial pressure, headaches, and potential vision loss, primarily affecting overweight women of childbearing age. With rising obesity rates in China, the consensus aims to improve awareness and diagnostic accuracy among healthcare professionals, emphasizing standardized diagnostic criteria and the importance of weight management. Acetazolamide is recommended as the first-line pharmacological treatment, while surgical options are suggested for severe cases. This consensus serves as a guideline to enhance IIH management in China.
