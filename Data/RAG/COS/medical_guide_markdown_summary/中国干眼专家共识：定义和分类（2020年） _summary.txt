The "China Dry Eye Expert Consensus: Definition and Classification (2020)" provides an updated definition and classification of dry eye disease, describing it as a chronic ocular surface condition caused by various factors that lead to tear film instability and discomfort. It classifies dry eye in three ways: by etiology (systemic, local, environmental, lifestyle, surgical, and medication-related factors), by tear film composition (including aqueous tear deficiency and other types), and by severity (mild, moderate, and severe). The consensus aims to standardize clinical diagnosis and treatment in China, addressing inconsistencies among practitioners.
