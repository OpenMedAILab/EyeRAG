The "Guidelines for the Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Diagnosis of Anterior Segment Diseases (2023)" provide a framework for integrating AI technologies in ophthalmology, focusing on conditions affecting the anterior segment of the eye. Developed by a consortium of Chinese medical experts, the guidelines highlight AI's potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making while addressing challenges like complex imaging techniques and the need for high-quality data. Key applications include diagnosing infectious keratitis, keratoconus, diabetic corneal neuropathy, and cataracts. The guidelines aim to support ophthalmologists in leveraging AI for better patient outcomes in anterior segment disease management.
