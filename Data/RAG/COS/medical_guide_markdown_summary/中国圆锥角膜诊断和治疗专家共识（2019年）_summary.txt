The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Keratoconus in China (2019)" provides guidelines for managing keratoconus, a progressive eye disease characterized by corneal thinning and protrusion, primarily affecting adolescents. It emphasizes the need for standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols due to inconsistencies in practice. Key points include the disease's global prevalence (0.05% to 0.23%, with 0.9% in individuals over 50 in China), risk factors (genetic, systemic diseases, environmental influences), clinical presentation, a proposed staging system for treatment guidance, and the importance of differential diagnosis. Treatment options range from non-surgical methods (education, glasses, contact lenses) to surgical interventions (corneal cross-linking, transplantation) for advanced cases. The consensus aims to enhance evidence-based management of keratoconus in China.
