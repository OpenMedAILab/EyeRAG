The Chinese Medical Association's expert consensus highlights the role of vitamin and mineral supplements in preventing and treating age-related cataracts, a major cause of blindness in the elderly. It notes that cataracts are linked to aging, genetics, and nutritional deficiencies, particularly antioxidants. Studies show a correlation between low levels of vitamins (A, C, E, B2) and minerals (zinc, selenium, magnesium) and cataract incidence. The consensus recommends daily intake of multivitamin and mineral supplements, especially those rich in antioxidants, to help prevent or delay cataract development.
