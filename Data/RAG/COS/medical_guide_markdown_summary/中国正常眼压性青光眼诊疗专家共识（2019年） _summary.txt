The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Normal Tension Glaucoma (NTG) in China" (2019) reports a 1.0% prevalence of NTG in China and stresses the importance of accurate intraocular pressure (IOP) classification to prevent misdiagnosis. Developed by the Ophthalmology Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, the consensus incorporates recent research to guide NTG diagnosis and treatment. Key findings highlight that a 30% reduction in IOP can slow visual field damage. NTG is classified into three types based on systemic risk factors and visual field progression, with treatment strategies focusing on managing these factors, lowering IOP, or monitoring stable cases. The document calls for ongoing research to adapt treatment protocols as new evidence emerges.
