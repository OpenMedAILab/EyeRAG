The consensus document establishes standardized guidelines for the Multi-Luminance Mobility Test (MLMT) in clinical trials for Inherited Retinal Dystrophy (IRD) in China. As gene and cell therapies advance, there is a need for effective visual function assessments beyond traditional Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), especially for patients with severe rod photoreceptor damage. The MLMT evaluates navigation abilities in varying light conditions but lacks unified guidelines, limiting its use in research. Developed by experts, the document aims to enhance clinical practice and research in ophthalmology, emphasizing the need for rigorous validation and standardization to improve treatment efficacy assessments for IRD patients.
