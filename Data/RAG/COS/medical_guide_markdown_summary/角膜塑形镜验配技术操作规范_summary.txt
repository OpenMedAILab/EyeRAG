The "2024 Guidelines for Fitting Orthokeratology Lenses" provide technical standards for fitting reverse geometry rigid gas-permeable contact lenses to correct refractive errors temporarily. Key sections include basic requirements for the fitting environment and equipment, indications and contraindications for suitable candidates, detailed operational procedures for the fitting process, and management of common issues like infections and dry eye. The guidelines stress the importance of patient education, compliance, and regular follow-ups to ensure safe lens use, with plans for future revisions as clinical practices evolve.
