The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Keratoplasty (2022)" provides guidelines for using femtosecond laser technology in corneal transplantation to restore vision in patients with corneal blindness. It emphasizes precise preparation of donor and recipient corneas and effective suturing to reduce postoperative astigmatism. Femtosecond laser-assisted keratoplasty (FLAK) is noted for its improved precision and visual outcomes compared to traditional methods. The document covers indications, contraindications, preoperative assessments, surgical design, and complication management, while promoting collaboration between refractive and transplant surgeons. It aims to standardize practices in China and improve the quality of corneal transplantation.
