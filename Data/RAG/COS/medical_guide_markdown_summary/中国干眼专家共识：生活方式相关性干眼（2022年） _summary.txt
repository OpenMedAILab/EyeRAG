The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Dry Eye: Lifestyle-Related Dry Eye" (2022) emphasizes the link between dry eye incidence and lifestyle factors, building on a 2020 consensus. Developed by Chinese ophthalmology experts, it aims to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of lifestyle-related dry eye. Key points include:

1. **Definition**: Dry eye linked to poor lifestyle habits, often improving with lifestyle changes.
2. **Classification**: Three types based on causative factors—behavioral (e.g., excessive screen time), environmental (e.g., air conditioning), and dietary (e.g., poor nutrition).
3. **Pathological Mechanisms**: Various lifestyle factors affect tear production and stability.
4. **Clinical Features**: Symptoms include dryness, redness, and discomfort, varying by cause.
5. **Diagnosis**: A comprehensive approach using questionnaires and assessments is recommended.
6. **Prevention and Treatment**: Focus on lifestyle modifications, alongside pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments.

This consensus serves as a clinical reference for managing lifestyle-related dry eye in China.
