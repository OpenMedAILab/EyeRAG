The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Contact Lens Adverse Reactions in China (2021)" provides guidelines from the Chinese Health Management Association's Committee on Contact Lens Safety and Visual Health, addressing the rising need for safe contact lens practices as usage increases, especially among youth. It categorizes adverse reactions into ocular surface abnormalities (e.g., conjunctivitis, corneal issues) and visual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision, glare). Key points include management strategies for conjunctival and corneal reactions, the importance of tear film integrity for comfort, and guidelines for addressing visual disturbances. This consensus serves as a vital resource for eye care professionals to improve contact lens safety and efficacy in China.
