The expert consensus on diagnosing ocular infectious diseases emphasizes their role as a major cause of blindness in developing countries, particularly in China, where diagnostic capabilities are often inadequate. It calls for standardized microbiological testing methods and outlines protocols for specimen collection, transportation, and quality assessment. The consensus provides guidelines for diagnosing common infections like conjunctivitis, keratitis, and endophthalmitis, recommending immediate specimen processing and collaboration between ophthalmologists and microbiologists. The goal is to enhance diagnosis and treatment of these diseases by establishing clear diagnostic pathways and improving laboratory capabilities.
