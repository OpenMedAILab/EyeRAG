The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI) in Children (2023)" by the Chinese Medical Association emphasizes the importance of early detection and intervention for CVI, a syndrome resulting from damage to central visual pathways that impacts children's development. It outlines 15 recommendations covering the definition, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of CVI, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary collaboration. Key points include defining CVI as a visual impairment unrelated to anterior visual pathway damage, identifying common causes like hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and recommending structured assessments and interventions such as visual stimulation and environmental adjustments. While the prognosis is generally poor, early and tailored interventions can improve outcomes. The consensus calls for increased awareness and research to enhance children's visual and developmental prospects.
