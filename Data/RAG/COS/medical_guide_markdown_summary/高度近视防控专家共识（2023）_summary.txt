The "Expert Consensus on Prevention and Control of High Myopia (2023)" highlights the rising global prevalence of high myopia, projected to increase from 4.0% to 9.8% by 2050, with particularly high rates in China, where 53.6% of school-aged children are affected. The consensus calls for early intervention to prevent irreversible vision loss linked to high myopia, which is categorized into stages and types. It identifies genetic and environmental risk factors and emphasizes the need for regular eye exams, lifestyle changes, and educational initiatives. Key recommendations include promoting outdoor activities, monitoring eye health, and using clinical interventions like specialized contact lenses and low-concentration atropine to slow progression, aiming to reduce complications and vision impairment in children and adolescents.
