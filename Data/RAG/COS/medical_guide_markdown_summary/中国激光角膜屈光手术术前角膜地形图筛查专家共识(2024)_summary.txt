The "Expert Consensus on Preoperative Corneal Topography Screening for Laser Corneal Refractive Surgery," developed by the Refractive Group of the Chinese Ethnic Health Association, emphasizes the need for accurate corneal topography assessments in response to the growing demand for laser refractive surgery in China. It outlines standardized procedures for preoperative checks, including patient preparation and equipment calibration, and highlights critical factors such as corneal thickness, curvature, and symmetry to assess risks like keratoconus. The consensus aims to enhance professional skills and improve the quality of preoperative assessments in qualified medical institutions across China.
