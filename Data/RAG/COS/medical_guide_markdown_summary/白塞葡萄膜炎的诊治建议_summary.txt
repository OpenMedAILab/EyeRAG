The document outlines clinical guidelines for diagnosing and treating Behçet's Uveitis (BU), a severe form of uveitis prevalent in China that can cause blindness. It addresses the challenges faced by healthcare professionals due to limited expertise in ophthalmology and rheumatology. Key points include the typical presentation of BU as recurrent posterior or pan-uveitis, diagnosis based on the 2014 International Study Group criteria, and treatment strategies that involve systemic immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and local therapies. The prognosis is generally poor, especially for younger males and those with posterior segment involvement. The guidelines aim to enhance BU management and will be updated with new evidence.
