The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Prophylaxis and Management of Traumatic Infectious Endophthalmitis (2023)" provides guidelines for diagnosing, treating, and preventing this condition, which arises from pathogens invading the eye after open globe injuries, with an incidence of 4% to 16%. It emphasizes the significance of early diagnosis, effective treatment, and preventive measures, especially for high-risk patients. The consensus covers epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic criteria, treatment protocols (including antibiotics and antifungals), and the importance of timely surgical intervention and wound closure to enhance patient outcomes in traumatic infectious endophthalmitis.
