The 2020 consensus on autologous serum eye drops (ASED) highlights their preparation, application, and benefits in treating corneal and ocular surface diseases. ASED, made from a patient's blood, contains growth factors that aid in healing and maintaining ocular surface stability, offering advantages over commercial drops. The consensus calls for standardized preparation methods to avoid contamination and misuse, as ASED is primarily used for severe ocular surface diseases, acute injuries, and as supportive therapy in surgeries, but is contraindicated in infections and certain systemic conditions. It emphasizes the need for sterile techniques and notes that while ASED is considered safe and effective, further research is necessary to establish standardized protocols.
