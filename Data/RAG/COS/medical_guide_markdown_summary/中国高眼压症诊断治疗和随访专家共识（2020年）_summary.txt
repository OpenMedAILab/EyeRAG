The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-up of Ocular Hypertension in China (2020)" provides guidelines for managing ocular hypertension (OHT), defined by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) without glaucomatous damage. It highlights the need for accurate diagnosis, risk assessment, and personalized treatment to prevent glaucoma progression. Key diagnostic criteria include IOP above 21 mmHg and open anterior chamber angles, while risk factors include corneal thickness, age, and IOP levels. First-line treatment involves pressure-lowering medications, particularly prostaglandin analogs, with selective laser trabeculoplasty as an alternative. The consensus also addresses special considerations for children and adolescents, aiming to standardize OHT management in China.
