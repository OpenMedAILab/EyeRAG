The "Expert Consensus on the Day Surgery Process in Ophthalmology in China" (2018) highlights the shift towards outpatient day surgery in ophthalmology, particularly for cataract removal. It defines day surgery as procedures completed within one day and emphasizes their safety and cost-effectiveness. The consensus recommends suitable ophthalmic procedures, establishes strict admission criteria for institutions and patients, and outlines standard operational procedures, including pre-operative assessments and post-operative care. The document aims to standardize day surgery practices in ophthalmology across China while allowing for institutional flexibility.
