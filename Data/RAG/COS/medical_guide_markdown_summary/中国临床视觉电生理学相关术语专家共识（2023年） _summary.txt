The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Clinical Visual Electrophysiology Terminology (2023)" was created by the Visual Physiology Groups of the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Ophthalmologist Association to standardize terminology in clinical visual electrophysiology. This consensus aligns with international standards from the ISCEV and aims to improve communication and research in ophthalmology by addressing terminology inconsistencies. It provides key definitions related to electrophysiology, electroretinograms, and visual evoked potentials to enhance clinical practice in China.
