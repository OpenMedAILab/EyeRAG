The "Expert Consensus on the Clinical Application of Multifocal Intraocular Lenses (MIOL) in China" (2019) provides guidelines for MIOL use in cataract surgery, focusing on patient selection, preoperative preparation, surgical technique, and postoperative care. Developed by the Ophthalmology Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, the consensus aims to standardize MIOL application to improve surgical outcomes and visual quality. Key points include the principles of MIOLs, suitable patient criteria, thorough preoperative assessments, specific surgical techniques, and the importance of regular postoperative follow-ups to address potential issues. The consensus advocates for personalized approaches to optimize MIOL benefits while minimizing risks.
