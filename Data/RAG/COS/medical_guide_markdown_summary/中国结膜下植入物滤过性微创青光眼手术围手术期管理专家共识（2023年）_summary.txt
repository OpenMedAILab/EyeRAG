The 2023 expert consensus from the Glaucoma Group of the Chinese Medical Association focuses on the perioperative management of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) with subconjunctival implants. MIGS is preferred for its effectiveness in lowering intraocular pressure, minimal invasiveness, and quick recovery, leading to its growing popularity in China. The guidelines, based on extensive research, aim to standardize clinical practices and improve patient outcomes. Key points include the categorization of MIGS into internal and external approaches, detailed surgical protocols, and postoperative management strategies to monitor and address potential complications. The consensus seeks to enhance the safety and efficacy of MIGS through standardized practices.
