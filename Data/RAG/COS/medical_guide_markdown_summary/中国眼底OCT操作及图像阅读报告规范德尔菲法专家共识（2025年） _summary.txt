The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Standardization of OCT and Image Interpretation and Reporting in Fundus Diseases (2025)" addresses the rising prevalence of fundus diseases, a major cause of blindness in China. It emphasizes the importance of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a diagnostic tool while acknowledging challenges in its use. Developed by experts through a modified Delphi method, the consensus aims to standardize OCT procedures, image quality control, and reporting practices to improve clinical management and research.

Key recommendations include using OCT for patients with eye diseases, its superiority over color fundus photography for early detection of conditions like age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, guidelines for proper operation and image interpretation, and standardized reporting formats. The consensus seeks to enhance OCT's effectiveness in clinical practice and reduce blindness from fundus diseases in China, with future updates planned to incorporate technological advancements.
