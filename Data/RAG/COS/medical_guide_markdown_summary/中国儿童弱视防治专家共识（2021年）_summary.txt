The "Expert Consensus on Prevention and Treatment of Amblyopia in Children" (2021) defines amblyopia as reduced vision due to visual deprivation or abnormal binocular interaction, classified into four types: strabismic, ametropic, anisometropic, and visual deprivation amblyopia. Early diagnosis and intervention are essential, involving the removal of visual deprivation, optical correction, and patching of the non-amblyopic eye. The consensus stresses regular vision assessments for children aged 0-6, especially those with a family history of vision problems, and calls for public education on amblyopia risks and the importance of early detection and treatment.
