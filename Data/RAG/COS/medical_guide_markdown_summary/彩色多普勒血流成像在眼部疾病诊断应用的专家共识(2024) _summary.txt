The "Expert Consensus on the Application of Color Doppler Flow Imaging (CDFI) in the Diagnosis of Ocular Diseases (2024)" highlights the importance of CDFI in evaluating ocular blood flow and diagnosing eye conditions. Despite its long history, standardized protocols for CDFI are lacking in China, hindering effective diagnosis. The consensus aims to establish uniform procedures and recommendations for CDFI use in ophthalmology, particularly for conditions like retinal and choroidal detachments, vitreous hemorrhage, and tumors. It stresses the need for better training and consistency in CDFI practices to improve patient care and resource efficiency in ocular diagnostics.
