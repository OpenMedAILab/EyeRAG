The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Neuroregulatory Surgical Treatment of Meige Syndrome (2021 Edition)" provides guidelines for the surgical management of Meige syndrome, a craniofacial dystonia affecting primarily women aged 40-70. It advocates for deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a minimally invasive treatment, focusing on the globus pallidus internus and subthalamic nucleus. The consensus outlines the mechanisms, indications, contraindications, surgical methods, and evaluation criteria for DBS, emphasizing the importance of cognitive and psychological assessments and a multidisciplinary approach. Key considerations include careful patient selection, precise electrode placement, and complication management, aiming to standardize practices and improve care for Meige syndrome patients.
