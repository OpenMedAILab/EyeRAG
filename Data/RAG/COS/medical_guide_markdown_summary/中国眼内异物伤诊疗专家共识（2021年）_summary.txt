The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Intraocular Foreign Bodies" (2021) addresses the challenges and protocols for managing intraocular foreign body injuries, which can severely impact vision. It highlights the importance of standardized diagnostic and treatment guidelines for ophthalmologists. Key points include the necessity of thorough patient history and ophthalmic examination, the role of advanced imaging techniques, tailored surgical interventions based on the foreign body's characteristics, and the importance of postoperative care to monitor complications. Prognosis varies based on the foreign body's nature and the extent of ocular damage, serving as a valuable reference for improving management practices in this area.
