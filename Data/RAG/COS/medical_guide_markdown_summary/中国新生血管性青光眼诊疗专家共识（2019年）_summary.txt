The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG)" by the Glaucoma Group of the Chinese Medical Association aims to standardize clinical practices for NVG, a condition that can cause irreversible vision loss due to new blood vessel formation on the iris and angle, often stemming from retinal ischemia. The consensus details the condition's etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, staging, and treatment principles, focusing on vision preservation and symptom relief. Key treatments include panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), anti-VEGF therapy, and surgical options to manage intraocular pressure, along with the importance of ongoing management of related systemic and ocular conditions to prevent recurrence and complications.
