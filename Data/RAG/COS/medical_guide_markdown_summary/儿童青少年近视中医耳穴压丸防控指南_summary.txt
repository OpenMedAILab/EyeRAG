The "Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Myopia in Children and Adolescents Using Traditional Chinese Medicine Ear Acupressure" address the rising myopia rates among youth in China, which reached 51.9% in 2022. Emphasizing early intervention, the guidelines advocate for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) techniques, particularly ear acupressure, to manage myopia. They provide detailed methodologies, including definitions, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations, along with specific acupoints for different myopia stages. The guidelines also highlight the importance of lifestyle changes, such as proper reading posture and outdoor activities, to reduce myopia risk. Aimed at healthcare providers and policymakers, the document promotes a combined approach of TCM and modern interventions to improve visual health.
