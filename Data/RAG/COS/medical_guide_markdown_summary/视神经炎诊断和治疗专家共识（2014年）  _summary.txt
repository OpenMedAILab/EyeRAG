The 2014 Expert Consensus on Optic Neuritis (ON) by the Neuro-Ophthalmology Group of the Chinese Medical Association provides guidelines on the classification, diagnosis, and treatment of ON, a major cause of blindness in young adults. ON is classified into idiopathic (including multiple sclerosis-related and neuromyelitis optica-related), infectious, and autoimmune types. Key clinical features include acute vision loss and pain in idiopathic cases, with varying recovery rates. Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment and exclusion of other conditions. First-line treatment for non-infectious ON is corticosteroids, with immunosuppressants for recurrence prevention. The consensus advocates for standardized protocols to enhance patient outcomes.
