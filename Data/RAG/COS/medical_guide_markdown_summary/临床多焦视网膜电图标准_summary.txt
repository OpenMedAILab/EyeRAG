The document presents updated clinical standards for multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) by the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV), replacing the 2007 guidelines. mfERG assesses local retinal function by recording responses from multiple retinal regions under photopic conditions. Key points include that mfERG is not a substitute for full-field ERG, emphasizes flexible stimulus parameters, and stresses the importance of proper electrode placement and calibration. It also details technical recording aspects and the need for facility-specific normative data. The standards aim to improve the consistency and comparability of mfERG results across clinical settings.
