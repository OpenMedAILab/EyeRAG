The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Drug-Related Dry Eye" (2021) provides guidelines for addressing dry eye caused by medications, which is often misdiagnosed. Developed by experts from various ophthalmological organizations in China, the consensus covers definitions, classifications, risk factors, common drugs, mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. Key points include the categorization of drug-related dry eye into local and systemic types, identification of risk factors, and common medications that contribute to the condition. It emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment, including medication adjustments and the use of lubricants, while advocating for preventive measures for at-risk patients. The consensus aims to improve the understanding and management of drug-related dry eye among ophthalmologists in China.
