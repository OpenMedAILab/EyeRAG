The "Clinical Application Guidelines for Chinese Patent Medicines in the Treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa" provide standardized recommendations for using Chinese patent medicines (CPM) to manage retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an irreversible eye disease with no approved treatments. Developed through literature review and expert consensus, the guidelines emphasize the clinical effectiveness and safety of specific CPMs, such as Fufang Xue Taotong Capsules and Qiju Dihuang Wan, in conjunction with conventional therapies to enhance vision and quality of life. While aiming to rationalize CPM use and reduce blindness rates, the guidelines acknowledge limitations due to low evidence quality and call for further research. Regular updates will be made based on new findings and clinical feedback.
