The "Strabismus Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines" emphasize the critical need for early diagnosis and treatment of strabismus in children to prevent visual impairment. They provide a detailed diagnostic approach, including patient history, visual acuity, and specialized eye examinations. Strabismus is classified into types such as latent, congenital, accommodative, and non-accommodative, each with specific treatment protocols ranging from corrective lenses to surgery. The guidelines also stress the importance of thorough preoperative assessments, sterile surgical techniques, and careful postoperative follow-up, serving as a comprehensive resource for healthcare professionals in managing strabismus.
