The 2021 Chinese expert consensus emphasizes the importance of timely management of diabetic macular edema (DME), a common complication of diabetic retinopathy, particularly in China, which has the highest number of diabetes patients. Aflibercept, an anti-VEGF drug, is recommended as a first-line treatment due to its superior efficacy in improving visual acuity and reducing retinal thickness compared to traditional laser treatments. The consensus details its pharmacological mechanisms, treatment protocols, and safety profile, while advocating for a structured clinical approach and further research to enhance treatment strategies and long-term safety.
