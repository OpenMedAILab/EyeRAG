The "2023 Clinical Guidelines for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) in China," developed by the Chinese Vitreo-Retina Society and the Fundus Disease Group of the Chinese Ophthalmologist Association, aim to standardize the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and follow-up of AMD, a leading cause of vision loss in the elderly. With the aging population and advancements in imaging and drug therapies, these guidelines address existing knowledge gaps among ophthalmologists and are registered with the International Practice Guidelines Registration and Transparency platform.
