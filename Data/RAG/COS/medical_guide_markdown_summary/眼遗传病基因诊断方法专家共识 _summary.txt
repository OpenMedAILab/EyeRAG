The Chinese Ophthalmic Genetic Alliance has developed a consensus on genetic diagnosis methods for ocular genetic diseases, highlighting the complexities of diagnosing conditions linked to genetic defects. As of April 2018, 440 ocular diseases are listed in the OMIM database, with common conditions including retinitis pigmentosa and congenital glaucoma. The consensus underscores the role of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in enhancing molecular diagnosis for single-gene disorders, while addressing challenges like genetic heterogeneity. Recommendations include standardized gene testing protocols, comprehensive genetic analysis using NGS, and verification of results through traditional methods like Sanger sequencing. The document also details clinical features and genetic characteristics of various ocular diseases, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and potential gene therapy.
