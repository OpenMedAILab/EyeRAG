The 2023 Chinese expert consensus on Behcet's uveitis emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent blindness caused by this chronic inflammatory disease, which affects multiple systems and commonly leads to ocular complications. Key points include the prevalence of uveitis in about 80% of patients, reliance on clinical symptoms and the International Criteria for Behcet's Disease for diagnosis, and the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologics for treatment. Complications like cataracts and glaucoma require careful management, as prognosis worsens without timely intervention.
