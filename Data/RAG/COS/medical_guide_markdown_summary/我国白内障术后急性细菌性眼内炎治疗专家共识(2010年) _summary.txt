The "Expert Consensus on the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Endophthalmitis After Cataract Surgery" (2010) addresses the management of a serious complication occurring in about 1.3% of cataract surgeries. It stresses the importance of early diagnosis and standardized treatment protocols in China, informed by guidelines from Japan and Europe. Key recommendations include assessing visual acuity and identifying pathogens, varying treatment approaches based on infection severity, specific guidelines for antibiotic preparation and administration, and recommending vitrectomy for severe cases. The consensus also suggests adjunctive therapies and aims to enhance treatment outcomes while minimizing discrepancies in care standards across different regions in China.
