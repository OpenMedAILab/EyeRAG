The expert consensus on intraoperative Schlemm canal fluorescein sodium angiography provides a protocol for managing acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (APACG). It advises maintaining current eye pressure medications while administering a 250 ml intravenous infusion of 20% mannitol. A trabeculectomy should be performed the following day, ensuring complete removal of subconjunctival tissue with TAC deposits. Postoperative normal eye pressure is anticipated. Concerns include the risk of sterile conjunctival ulcers from TAC injections, potential accumulation in the anterior chamber affecting visual acuity, and the need for standardized glucocorticoid treatment for APACG in China.
