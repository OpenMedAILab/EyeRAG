The "Expert Consensus on Perioperative Management Strategies for Cataract Surgery in Diabetic Patients" (2020) provides guidelines to minimize complications in diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery. Key recommendations include controlling blood sugar levels, careful timing of surgery based on cataract severity and retinal conditions, and using NSAIDs to manage inflammation. The choice of intraocular lens should focus on basic visual needs, favoring hydrophobic materials to lower the risk of secondary cataracts. Frequent postoperative follow-up is essential for early detection of complications. The consensus aims to standardize care and improve surgical outcomes for diabetic patients.
