The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Dry Eye: Examination and Diagnosis (2020)" updates diagnostic standards for dry eye in clinical practice, building on 2013 guidelines. Developed by Chinese ophthalmological associations, it incorporates new diagnostic techniques tailored to local patient needs. Key elements include symptom questionnaires, tear film stability tests, and assessments of tear secretion and ocular surface integrity. The consensus promotes a structured diagnostic approach using both non-invasive and invasive methods to evaluate dry eye severity and distinguish it from other ocular surface diseases, aiming to standardize diagnosis and improve patient outcomes in China.
