The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Corneal Endothelial Transplantation (2024)" provides guidelines for endothelial keratoplasty (EK), a treatment for corneal endothelial diseases, developed by the Cornea Group of the Chinese Medical Association. It focuses on mastering surgical techniques, managing complications, and standardizing practices in China. EK includes Descemet Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK) and Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK), which offer improved visual recovery and lower rejection rates compared to penetrating keratoplasty. The consensus covers indications, preoperative assessments, surgical techniques, and postoperative management, stressing the need for experienced surgeons, proper equipment, careful patient selection, and thorough evaluations to minimize complications.
