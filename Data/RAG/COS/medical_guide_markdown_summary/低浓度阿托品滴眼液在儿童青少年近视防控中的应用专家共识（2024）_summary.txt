The "Expert Consensus on the Application of Low-Concentration Atropine Eye Drops in the Prevention and Control of Myopia in Children and Adolescents (2024)" highlights the rising global prevalence of myopia, particularly in China, where rates reached 51.9% in 2022. It endorses the use of 0.01% atropine eye drops, approved in March 2024, as an effective and safe method to slow myopia progression with fewer side effects than higher concentrations. The consensus also suggests exploring combined treatments and emphasizes the need for further research on preventive effects in non-myopic children. Safety concerns are addressed, noting that adverse reactions are generally mild. Guidelines for clinical use, including patient assessment and follow-up, aim to standardize atropine use in practice and will be updated as new findings arise.
