The "Asian Consensus on Myopia Management," developed by the Asian Optometric Management Association and the Asian Optometric Conference, provides evidence-based guidelines for managing myopia, particularly in East and Southeast Asia, where youth prevalence is high. Key points include defining myopia and its classifications, setting clinical goals to assess and control progression, and identifying lifestyle risk factors. Recommended management strategies involve increasing outdoor activity, reducing near work, and using optical and pharmacological treatments. The guidelines emphasize the importance of regular monitoring and public health initiatives to raise awareness about myopia prevention and management. Overall, the consensus aims to guide eye care professionals in effectively addressing myopia and its public health implications.
