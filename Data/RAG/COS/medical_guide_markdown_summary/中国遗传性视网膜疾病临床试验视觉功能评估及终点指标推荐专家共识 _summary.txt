The expert consensus document provides recommendations for evaluating visual function and outcome measures in clinical trials for inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) in China, amidst advancements in gene therapy. Due to the heterogeneity of IRDs and significant visual impairment in patients, establishing standardized outcome measures is challenging. Experts from the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Medical Doctor Association propose guidelines to standardize efficacy evaluation and endpoint selection. Key recommendations include using best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) as a primary endpoint, while also considering alternative measures like full-field stimulus threshold (FST) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for patients with severe impairment. The goal is to improve the design and evaluation of IRD clinical trials, enhancing understanding and treatment of these rare diseases.
