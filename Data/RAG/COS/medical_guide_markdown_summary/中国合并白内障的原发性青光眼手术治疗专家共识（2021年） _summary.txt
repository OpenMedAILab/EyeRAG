The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Surgical Treatment of Primary Glaucoma with Cataract" (2021) outlines guidelines for managing the common combination of primary glaucoma and cataract in China, advocating surgery as the primary treatment. Developed by the Glaucoma Group of the Chinese Medical Association, it addresses surgical methods, perioperative management, and follow-up care. Key recommendations include phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation (Phaco+IOL) and combined surgeries, along with the importance of monitoring intraocular pressure and managing complications. The consensus stresses the need for thorough preoperative assessments and ongoing follow-up to manage the progression of both conditions.
