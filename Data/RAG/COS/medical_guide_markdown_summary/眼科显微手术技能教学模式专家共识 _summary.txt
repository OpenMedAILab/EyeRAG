The "Expert Consensus on the Teaching Model of Skills Training in Ophthalmic Microsurgery" presents a structured four-stage approach for training medical students and young physicians in ophthalmic microsurgery. The stages include: 

1. **Basic Skills (I)** - Fundamental techniques using simulation tools.
2. **Advanced Skills (II)** - Complex procedures like suturing through simulations and animal models.
3. **Pre-Clinical Specialized Training (III)** - Preparation for specific surgeries using simulators and animal eyes.
4. **Clinical Practice (IV)** - Hands-on training in clinical settings focusing on patient management.

The model combines theoretical and practical methods, including online resources and assessments, to standardize training, enhance learning efficiency, and improve the quality of ophthalmic microsurgery education.
