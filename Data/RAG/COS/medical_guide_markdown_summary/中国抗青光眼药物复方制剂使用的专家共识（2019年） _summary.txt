The "Expert Consensus on the Use of Combination Formulations for Antiglaucoma Medications in China (2019)" emphasizes the role of pharmacological treatment in managing open-angle glaucoma, particularly the increasing use of combination therapies to achieve target intraocular pressure (IOP). These formulations provide benefits such as stable IOP reduction, fewer side effects, and better patient adherence. While not typically first-line treatments, they are recommended for advanced cases or high baseline IOP. Caution is advised against using combinations with similar active ingredients, and individualized treatment plans are essential, especially for pregnant patients. The consensus aims to optimize treatment efficacy while minimizing costs and side effects.
