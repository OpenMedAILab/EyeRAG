The consensus on managing major chronic fundus diseases in China addresses the rising prevalence linked to an aging population and highlights challenges such as low public awareness, inadequate screening, and high missed follow-ups, leading to poor treatment outcomes and increased blindness rates. The "14th Five-Year Plan for Eye Health" calls for a robust prevention and control system. Experts have developed a management model using a modified Delphi method, focusing on improving patient compliance, optimizing healthcare resources, and enhancing treatment effectiveness for conditions like diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion. The consensus also advocates for online platforms for remote patient management to improve communication and adherence, aiming to establish a comprehensive system that reduces the burden of these diseases and enhances patient outcomes.
