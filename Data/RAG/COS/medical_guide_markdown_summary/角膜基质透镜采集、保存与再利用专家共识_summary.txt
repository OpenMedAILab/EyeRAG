The Division of Refractive Surgery, Branch of Ophthalmology, China National Health Association has established a consensus on the collection, preservation, and reuse of corneal stromal lenticules from small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). This consensus highlights the need for standardized protocols to ensure safety and quality, covering aspects such as collection, labeling, storage, and transportation. Lenticules can be utilized for treating corneal diseases and correcting refractive errors. The guidelines emphasize ethical practices, safety measures, and traceability to enhance clinical applications and encourage further research.
