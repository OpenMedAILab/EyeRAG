The "Expert Consensus on Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Corneal Epithelial Injury" (2016) by the Chinese Medical Association defines corneal epithelial injury as a condition where the corneal epithelial barrier is compromised, leading to cell loss and potential vision impairment. Causes include congenital factors, trauma, infections, tear film dysfunction, nerve issues, inflammation, eyelid abnormalities, corneal degeneration, medications, and systemic diseases. Symptoms manifest as eye irritation, blurred vision, and signs like corneal edema and epithelial defects. Diagnosis involves patient history, clinical signs, and tests such as fluorescein staining. Treatment focuses on removing causative factors, local therapies, anti-inflammatory medications, and, in severe cases, surgical interventions, with management strategies tailored to the injury's severity.
