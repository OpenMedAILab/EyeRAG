The "Chinese Guideline for Cataract Surgery in Adults (2023)" was created by the Chinese Cataract and Refractive Surgery Society to standardize cataract surgery practices in response to its rising prevalence in China. It offers detailed recommendations on preoperative assessment, surgical techniques, IOL selection, anesthesia, infection prevention, and postoperative care, emphasizing individualized patient evaluation and evidence-based practices. The guideline will be updated regularly to incorporate new clinical evidence and technological advancements, aiming to enhance the quality of care for cataract patients in China.
