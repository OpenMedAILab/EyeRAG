The "Expert Consensus on the Classification and Management of Eye Disease Screening for High-Risk Neonates (2024)" was created by a multidisciplinary team in China to address eye disease screening challenges for high-risk neonates. It advocates for standardized risk classification and tiered management of screening services, recommending initial eye screenings for all surviving neonates, especially those born prematurely or with specific medical conditions. The document details screening methods, follow-up needs, and timely referrals to specialized care, aiming to enhance early detection and treatment of eye diseases to prevent childhood vision impairment and blindness. It will be updated every 3-5 years to incorporate new evidence and practices.
