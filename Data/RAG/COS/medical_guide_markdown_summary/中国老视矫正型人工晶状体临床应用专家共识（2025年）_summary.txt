The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Clinical Application of Presbyopia-Correcting Intraocular Lenses (IOLs) (2025)" outlines guidelines for addressing the rising demand for presbyopia correction amid global aging. Developed by the Chinese Cataract and Refractive Surgery Society, it covers definitions, indications, contraindications, and clinical applications of presbyopia-correcting IOLs. The consensus stresses personalized treatment plans, including preoperative assessments, IOL selection, and postoperative follow-up, while also addressing potential complications and the importance of patient communication. It discusses key IOL types—multifocal, extended depth of focus, and adjustable lenses—recommending their use based on individual patient needs.
