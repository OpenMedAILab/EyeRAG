The document outlines expert recommendations for combining peripheral iridectomy (SPI) with goniosynechialysis (GSL) and goniotomy (GT) to treat primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). It emphasizes the growing importance of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) for PACG patients without cataracts and calls for standardized protocols on surgical indications, anesthesia, procedures, and perioperative care to improve treatment outcomes. The guidelines cover patient selection, anesthesia options, surgical techniques, and postoperative care, aiming to enhance the safety and efficacy of this combined approach and support consistent treatment practices in PACG management.
