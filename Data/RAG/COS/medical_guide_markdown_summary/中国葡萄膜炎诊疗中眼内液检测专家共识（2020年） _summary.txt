The "Expert Consensus on Intraocular Fluid Testing in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Uveitis in China (2020)" provides guidelines for the clinical use of intraocular fluid testing in diagnosing uveitis, an inflammatory eye disease. Developed by the Ophthalmic Immunology Group of the Chinese Medical Association, it emphasizes that this invasive procedure is primarily suitable for specific infectious uveitis cases. Key points include recommendations for testing in bacterial or fungal endophthalmitis, lymphoma-related syndromes, and certain parasitic infections; detailed methods for fluid collection; careful interpretation of results to avoid misdiagnosis; and a caution against unnecessary testing, as most uveitis cases can be diagnosed clinically. The consensus aims to standardize testing practices to improve patient care while reducing unnecessary procedures.
