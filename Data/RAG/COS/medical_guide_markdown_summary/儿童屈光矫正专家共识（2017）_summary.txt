The "Consensus Guidelines of Refractive Correction for Children" (2017) by the Chinese Optometric Association and the Chinese Ophthalmological Society outlines strategies for managing refractive errors in children, particularly myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. Key recommendations include early intervention for myopia, regular follow-ups every six months, and the use of cycloplegic agents for accurate refraction in children under 12. The guidelines advocate for various correction methods, including glasses and contact lenses, and emphasize the importance of increasing outdoor activities as a preventive measure against myopia. Overall, the guidelines aim to enhance early detection and management of refractive errors to reduce the risk of long-term visual impairment.
