The "Expert Consensus on Infection Prevention during Corneal Refractive Surgery amid the COVID-19 Pandemic," developed by the Refractive Surgery Group of the Chinese Medical Association, outlines essential infection control measures for eye surgeries due to increased infection risks. It emphasizes adherence to national guidelines and international practices, including patient risk assessment, enhanced protective equipment for staff, and specific protocols for all surgical phases. Key recommendations involve classifying patients by risk, scheduling appointments to reduce crowding, and thorough disinfection of equipment. The consensus aims to ensure safe corneal refractive surgeries while minimizing infection risks during the pandemic, with potential adjustments as the situation changes.
