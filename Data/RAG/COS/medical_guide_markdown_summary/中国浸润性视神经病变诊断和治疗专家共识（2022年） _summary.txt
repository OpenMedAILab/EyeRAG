The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infiltrative Optic Neuropathy (ION)" (2022) provides guidelines for managing ION, a rare condition caused by tumor or inflammatory cell infiltration in the optic nerve. Often misdiagnosed as optic perineuritis or neuritis, ION can lead to delayed treatment and unnecessary steroid side effects. The consensus outlines the condition's definition, diagnosis, and treatment protocols, emphasizing the need for accurate classification of its causes, which include malignant tumors, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Key diagnostic methods involve patient history, clinical symptoms, MRI, and lab tests. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, potentially involving chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy, to address underlying conditions and prevent irreversible vision loss.
