The "2024 Guidelines for Corneal Refractive Lens Extraction Surgery" establish standards for using femtosecond laser technology to correct refractive errors. Key components include:

1. **Basic Requirements**: Standards for surgical facilities and surgeon qualifications.
2. **Preoperative Assessment**: Evaluation of patient history and necessary tests for surgery suitability.
3. **Indications and Contraindications**: Criteria for patient eligibility and conditions that disqualify surgery.
4. **Informed Consent**: Importance of patient education on the procedure and its risks.
5. **Surgical Process**: Steps for environment preparation, patient readiness, and the surgical procedure.
6. **Perioperative Medications and Follow-Up**: Guidelines for medication and post-surgery care.
7. **Common Complications and Management**: Identification and management of potential complications.

These guidelines aim to standardize practices and enhance patient outcomes in the surgery.
