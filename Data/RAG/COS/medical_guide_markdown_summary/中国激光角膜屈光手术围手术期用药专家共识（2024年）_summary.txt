The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Perioperative Medication in Laser Corneal Refractive Surgery (2024)" was created by the Refractive Surgery Experts Group of the Chinese Society of Microcirculation to address the rising myopia rates in China and the importance of appropriate perioperative medication. This updated consensus builds on a 2019 document, incorporating recent research to improve clinical practices and surgical outcomes. Key medication categories include antibiotics, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, antiviral drugs, lubricating eye drops, intraocular pressure-lowering medications, and neuroregenerative agents. The consensus stresses the need for individualized medication plans tailored to patient conditions and surgical techniques to ensure safe and effective surgery.
