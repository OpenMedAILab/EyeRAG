The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of X-Linked Retinoschisis (XLRS) in China (2025)" was created by the Genetic Eye Disease Group of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association. XLRS is a hereditary retinal disorder caused by RS1 gene mutations, resulting in significant vision loss and quality of life issues. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, electroretinograms (ERG), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and genetic testing. While no effective treatment exists, gene replacement therapy shows promise. The consensus aims to standardize diagnosis and management practices, enhance clinician awareness, and promote early detection and intervention to preserve vision. Recommendations include diagnostic protocols, treatment advancements, and genetic counseling.
