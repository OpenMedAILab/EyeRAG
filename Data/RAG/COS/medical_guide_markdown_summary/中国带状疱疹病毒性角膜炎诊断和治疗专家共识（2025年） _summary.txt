The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Herpes Zoster Keratitis (2025)" provides guidelines for managing varicella zoster virus keratitis (VZK), a common and often misdiagnosed infectious corneal disease linked to herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). Developed by the Ocular Infection Group of the Chinese Ophthalmologist Association, the consensus highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and standardized treatment, addressing risk factors such as age and immunocompromised states. Key recommendations include using clinical history, symptoms, and PCR testing for diagnosis, and employing antiviral medications, corticosteroids, and supportive therapies for treatment. Preventive measures, particularly vaccination for those over 50, are also emphasized to improve patient outcomes.
