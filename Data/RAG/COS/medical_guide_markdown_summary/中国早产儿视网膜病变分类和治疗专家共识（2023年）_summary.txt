The "Expert Consensus on the Classification and Treatment of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) in China (2023)" presents updated guidelines for diagnosing and managing ROP, a major cause of neonatal blindness. Developed by experts from the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Medical Doctor Association, the consensus stresses early screening and regular follow-up to mitigate severe visual impairment. Key updates include a refined classification system, new terminology, and criteria for anti-VEGF therapies like Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab, which are effective in treating early and aggressive ROP. The document serves as a vital resource for clinicians caring for at-risk premature infants.
