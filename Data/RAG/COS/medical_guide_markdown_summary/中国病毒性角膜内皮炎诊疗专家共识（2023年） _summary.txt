The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Viral Corneal Endotheliitis (2023)" provides standardized guidelines for diagnosing and treating viral corneal endotheliitis, a serious condition that can lead to blindness. Developed by the Ocular Infection Group of the Chinese Ophthalmologist Association, the consensus outlines key aspects such as the definition of the condition, common viral causes (HSV, VZV, CMV), clinical symptoms (redness, light sensitivity, blurred vision), and diagnostic methods (patient history, clinical symptoms, in vivo confocal microscopy, PCR). Treatment primarily involves antiviral medications and corticosteroids, with surgical options for severe cases. The consensus highlights the need for timely intervention to improve patient outcomes and minimize recurrence risk.
