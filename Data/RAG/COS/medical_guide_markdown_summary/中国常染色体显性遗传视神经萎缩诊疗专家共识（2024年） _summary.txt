The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (ADOA)" was created by the China Alliance for Rare Diseases and the Neuro-ophthalmology Group of the Chinese Medical Association to address the challenges of diagnosing and treating ADOA, a rare condition that causes progressive vision loss due to retinal ganglion cell degeneration. The consensus highlights the need for improved awareness and standardized diagnostic procedures among ophthalmologists in China, as ADOA is often misdiagnosed. Key diagnostic methods include clinical features, OCT imaging, visual field tests, and genetic testing for the OPA1 gene. Current treatment options are limited to supportive care, with ongoing research into gene and stem cell therapies. Genetic counseling is emphasized due to the condition's autosomal dominant inheritance. The consensus aims to enhance clinical practice and research in ADOA management in China.
