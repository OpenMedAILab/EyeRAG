The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD): Definition and Classification (2023)" outlines MGD as a common ocular surface disease caused by chronic meibomian gland dysfunction, leading to discomfort and visual impairment. Developed by ophthalmology experts, the consensus aims to standardize diagnosis and treatment among Chinese clinicians. MGD is classified by etiology (individual, external, iatrogenic), secretion status (low, high output), and severity (mild, moderate, severe), and is associated with other conditions like dry eye and blepharitis. This consensus serves as a guideline for improving MGD management in clinical practice.
