The "Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment of Nonspecific Orbital Inflammation (2024)" provide a framework for understanding and managing nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI), characterized by unexplained orbital inflammation causing pain, exophthalmos, and vision impairment. Developed by an expert group, the guidelines emphasize the need to exclude specific causes before diagnosing NSOI, which can be misdiagnosed due to its variable presentation. They classify NSOI by symptom onset, anatomical involvement, and histopathological features, and recommend diagnostic approaches including ophthalmic assessments, lab tests, and imaging. Treatment primarily involves corticosteroids, with options like immunosuppressants, biological agents, radiation, and surgery as needed. The guidelines also highlight recurrence risk factors and complications of untreated NSOI, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy for better patient outcomes.
