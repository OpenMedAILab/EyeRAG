The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD): Diagnosis and Management (2023)" provides updated guidelines for diagnosing and treating MGD, a prevalent ocular surface disease. Developed by Chinese ophthalmology experts, it builds on a 2017 framework and incorporates recent research. Key diagnostic criteria include symptom assessment, meibomian gland status, secretion characteristics, and structural abnormalities. Treatment focuses on addressing causes, restoring gland function, and managing inflammation, with recommendations for physical treatments, pharmacological interventions, and advanced therapies like intense pulsed light therapy. A tailored approach is emphasized based on MGD severity, with specific strategies for mild, moderate, and severe cases.
