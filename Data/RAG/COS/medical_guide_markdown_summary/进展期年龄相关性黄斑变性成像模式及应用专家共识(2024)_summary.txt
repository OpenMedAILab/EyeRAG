The "Expert Consensus on Imaging Patterns and Applications for Advanced Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) (2024)" published in the Chinese Journal of Experimental Ophthalmology reviews imaging techniques for advanced AMD, highlighting their impact on vision. Key modalities include color fundus photography (CFP), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography (FFA), along with newer technologies like optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and multispectral imaging (MSI). The consensus stresses optimizing these techniques for accurate diagnosis and treatment, recommending CFP, OCT, and OCTA for initial screening, and OCTA for monitoring neovascular AMD. A multimodal imaging approach is advocated to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient management.
