The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Prevention and Control of COVID-19 Eye Disease" (2022) addresses the link between COVID-19 and various eye diseases, such as conjunctivitis. In response to the lack of standardized guidelines, experts developed a consensus to enhance management of these conditions in China. The document covers definitions, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, treatment options, and preventive measures. Key recommendations include protective measures for healthcare workers, accurate laboratory diagnosis, and public health advice to minimize transmission. The consensus also highlights the need for further research on the virus's impact on eye health and the importance of eye protection during the pandemic.
