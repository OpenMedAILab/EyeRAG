The "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Myopia in Children and Adolescents Using Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)" address the rising global prevalence of myopia, particularly in China. They advocate for early intervention to prevent myopia progression and related complications. TCM techniques such as ear acupressure, eye exercises, acupuncture, and dietary therapy are highlighted for their potential benefits. The guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations, categorize myopia, and discuss its epidemiology, risk factors, and treatment methods. They emphasize integrating TCM with conventional treatments to enhance outcomes and call for further research to support and adapt these recommendations.
