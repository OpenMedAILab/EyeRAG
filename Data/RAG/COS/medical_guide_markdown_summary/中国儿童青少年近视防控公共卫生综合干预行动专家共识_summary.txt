The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Comprehensive Public Health Intervention for Myopia Prevention and Control in Children and Adolescents" presents a framework to combat the increasing myopia rates among youth in China. Developed by key health organizations, it outlines six intervention strategies: establishing vision health records, assessing vision care behaviors, providing health education, improving reading environments, promoting outdoor activities, and implementing structured management for myopia. The consensus highlights the multifactorial causes of myopia and stresses the importance of early intervention and public health measures over corrective technologies. It calls for a collaborative effort among schools, families, and communities to enhance children's vision health.
