The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Immune-Related Peripheral Keratopathy (2022)" addresses the diagnosis and management of immune-related keratopathy, a condition resulting from abnormal immune responses that can impair vision. Developed by the Cornea Group of the Chinese Medical Association, it highlights the condition's diverse manifestations and frequent misdiagnosis, including diseases like Mooren's ulcer. Key aspects include the pathogenesis linked to autoimmune diseases and trauma, clinical symptoms such as redness and vision loss, diagnostic methods involving patient history and imaging, and treatment strategies that encompass systemic immunosuppressants, local therapies, and surgical options like amniotic membrane transplantation. The consensus aims to enhance early detection and treatment to improve patient outcomes.
