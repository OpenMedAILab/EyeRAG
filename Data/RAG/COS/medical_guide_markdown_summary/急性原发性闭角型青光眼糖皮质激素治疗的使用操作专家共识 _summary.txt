The expert consensus on corticosteroid use for acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (APACG) in China highlights the need for standardized management due to the risk of irreversible vision loss from high intraocular pressure. Current treatments focus on lowering eye pressure but do not address ischemic reperfusion and inflammation. Recent studies indicate that local corticosteroids may reduce inflammation and stabilize the blood-aqueous barrier, potentially decreasing postoperative complications. The consensus provides guidelines on corticosteroid indications, treatment protocols for surgeries, and possible adverse effects, aiming to enhance APACG management in China with plans for future updates based on new evidence.
