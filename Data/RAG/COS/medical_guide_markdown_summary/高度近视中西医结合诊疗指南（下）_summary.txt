The "Guidelines for the Integrated Treatment of High Myopia" by the Chinese Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine recommend a combined approach of Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for managing pathological myopia and its complications, such as posterior scleral staphyloma and macular degeneration. Key strategies include surgical options like posterior scleral reinforcement, TCM herbal formulations, early diagnosis, patient education on lifestyle changes, and regular eye exams. The guidelines provide specific TCM prescriptions for various conditions related to high myopia and advocate for a structured patient care approach.
