The "Expert Consensus on Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment for Thyroid-Related Eye Disease (Hubei)" provides guidelines for diagnosing and treating Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy (TAO), an autoimmune condition linked to thyroid disorders. Developed by Hubei medical associations, it advocates for integrating traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with Western practices. The consensus categorizes TAO by clinical activity and severity, offering diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols that include herbal remedies, acupuncture, and lifestyle changes. It emphasizes managing risk factors like smoking and thyroid function, and includes guidelines for patient care, dietary advice, and psychological support to improve TAO management and research.
