The "Expert Consensus on the Prevention and Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)" by the Chinese Diabetes Society addresses DR as a major complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness. It calls for standardized guidelines for screening, diagnosis, and management, emphasizing collaboration between endocrinologists and ophthalmologists. Key points include:

1. **Epidemiology**: DR affects 23% of diabetic patients in mainland China, with risk factors like hyperglycemia and hypertension.
2. **Screening and Referral**: Early detection through non-mydriatic fundus photography is crucial, with guidelines for referrals based on DR severity.
3. **Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis**: DR includes diabetic macular edema and vascular changes, with established international grading standards.
4. **Prevention and Treatment**: Managing blood glucose, pressure, and lipids is vital, along with treatments like laser therapy and anti-VEGF injections.
5. **Collaboration and Future Directions**: The consensus promotes a team approach and the use of technology, such as telemedicine and AI, to improve DR management in China.

Overall, it emphasizes the need for early detection and comprehensive care to enhance patients' quality of life.
