The "Guidelines for the Application of Artificial Intelligence in Automatic Segmentation and Disease Diagnosis of Retinal Images (2024)" detail the use of AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, in diagnosing retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Emphasizing early diagnosis for better patient outcomes, the guidelines provide a structured approach for AI integration in retinal image analysis, covering data preparation, feature extraction, and diagnostic analysis. Developed by experts, the guidelines address the need for standardized practices and discuss various imaging modalities, while acknowledging challenges such as data dependency and model generalization. The document envisions AI enhancing eye care quality and addressing healthcare disparities.
