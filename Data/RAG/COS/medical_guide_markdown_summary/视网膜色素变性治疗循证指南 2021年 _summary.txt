The "2021 Evidence-Based Guidelines for the Treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)" outline various treatment options for this hereditary retinal disease, including gene therapy, cell therapy, laser treatment, and surgical interventions. While traditional methods often lack strong clinical evidence, recent advancements in gene and cell therapies show promise and require further randomized controlled trials. The guidelines also address complications like cataracts and cystoid macular edema, providing treatment strategies for these issues. Overall, the document aims to equip ophthalmologists with evidence-based recommendations for managing RP and emphasizes the need for ongoing research to confirm treatment efficacy.
