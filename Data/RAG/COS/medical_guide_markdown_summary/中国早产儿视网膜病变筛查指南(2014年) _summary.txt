The "China Guidelines for Screening Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)" (2014) address the rising incidence of ROP in premature and low-birth-weight infants, highlighting its risk of blindness and societal impact. The guidelines define ROP, categorize its stages, and recommend screening for infants with a birth weight under 2000g or gestational age under 32 weeks, starting at 4-6 weeks post-birth. They outline qualifications for screening personnel, methods, and conditions for follow-up termination, aiming to improve early detection and treatment to reduce ROP-related blindness.
