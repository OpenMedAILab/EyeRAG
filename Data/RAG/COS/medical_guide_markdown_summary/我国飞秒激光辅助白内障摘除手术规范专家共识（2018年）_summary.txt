The "Expert Consensus on the Standards for Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery in China (2018)" outlines guidelines for using femtosecond laser technology in cataract surgery, which is crucial as cataracts are a leading cause of blindness. This method enhances precision in incisions and capsulotomies, improving surgical accuracy, effectiveness, and safety compared to traditional techniques. The consensus emphasizes the importance of surgeon qualifications, surgical environment standards, and specific indications for femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS). It highlights FLACS benefits, including reduced ultrasound energy use and better visual outcomes. Comprehensive preoperative assessments and careful patient selection are essential, along with detailed surgical protocols and postoperative follow-up to ensure optimal recovery and manage complications.
