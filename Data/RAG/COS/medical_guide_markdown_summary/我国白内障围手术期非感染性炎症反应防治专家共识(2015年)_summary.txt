The 2015 expert consensus in China on managing non-infectious inflammatory responses during cataract surgery highlights the critical need for effective postoperative inflammation management to prevent complications like pain and vision loss. It details the inflammatory mechanisms and recommends corticosteroids and NSAIDs for treatment. Key recommendations include preoperative NSAID use based on individual needs, minimizing intraoperative iris stimulation, and a postoperative regimen of corticosteroids and NSAIDs for two weeks, followed by NSAIDs alone for up to six weeks. Special considerations are advised for high-risk patients. The consensus advocates for standardized anti-inflammatory medication use and calls for further research to enhance treatment protocols.
