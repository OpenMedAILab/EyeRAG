The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Syphilitic Optic Neuritis (SON)" was established by the Chinese Ophthalmological Society in 2022 in response to the increasing syphilis rates in China. It highlights SON as a significant condition that can be easily misdiagnosed. The consensus details clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, treatment protocols, and follow-up strategies, stressing the need for standardized care. Key diagnostic methods include serological tests and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, while treatment primarily involves penicillin. The goal is to raise awareness and improve early diagnosis and management of SON to protect patients' vision.
