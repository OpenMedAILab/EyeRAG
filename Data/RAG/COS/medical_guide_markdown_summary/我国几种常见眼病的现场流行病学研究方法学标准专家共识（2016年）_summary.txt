The "Expert Consensus on Methodological Standards for Field Epidemiological Research on Common Eye Diseases in China" (2016) provides guidelines for studying major eye diseases, highlighting differences from clinical research. Key recommendations include using WHO definitions for blindness and visual impairment, defining myopia with cycloplegic refraction for children, adopting ISGEO standards for glaucoma diagnosis, and following ADA criteria for diabetic retinopathy. The consensus aims to standardize methodologies in eye disease epidemiology in China to improve public health outcomes and research comparability.
