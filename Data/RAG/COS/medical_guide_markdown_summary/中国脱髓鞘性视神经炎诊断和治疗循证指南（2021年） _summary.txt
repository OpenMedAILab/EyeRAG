The "Evidence-based Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Demyelinating Optic Neuritis (DON) in China (2021)" were created by the Neuro-ophthalmology Group of the Chinese Medical Association, Lanzhou University, and the WHO to standardize clinical practices for diagnosing and treating DON, an inflammatory condition affecting the optic nerve. The guidelines include 16 recommendations on diagnostic criteria, treatment strategies, and follow-up care, emphasizing high-dose corticosteroids for acute cases, antibody testing, and immunosuppressive therapy for specific subtypes. They aim to improve patient outcomes, reduce recurrence rates, and encourage ongoing research to adapt practices as new evidence arises.
