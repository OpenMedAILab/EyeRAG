The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Drug-Induced Keratopathy (2023)" outlines the corneal damage caused by ophthalmic drugs and their preservatives, highlighting the challenges of misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment due to varied clinical manifestations. Developed by the Cornea Group of the Chinese Medical Association, the consensus provides guidance on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Key points include the definition of drug-induced keratopathy, common causative agents (e.g., antibiotics, preservatives), high-risk patient groups (e.g., those undergoing cataract or glaucoma surgery), and the importance of thorough diagnosis and careful medication management. Treatment recommendations focus on discontinuing harmful drugs, using preservative-free alternatives, and supportive therapies tailored to severity. The consensus underscores the need for awareness of drug toxicity and patient-specific factors to reduce the risk of corneal damage.
