The "Expert Consensus on Orthokeratology Fitting Process (2021)" provides guidelines for fitting orthokeratology lenses to temporarily reduce myopia by reshaping the cornea. Key points include:

1. **Indications and Contraindications**: Suitable for specific myopic patients; contraindications include children under 8, certain medications, and active eye conditions.
   
2. **Fitting Process**: Involves four stages: pre-fitting examination, lens dispensing, first-day follow-up, and ongoing check-ups to monitor adaptation and lens performance.

3. **Examination Protocols**: Emphasizes informed consent, thorough assessments, and patient education on lens care.

4. **Safety and Monitoring**: Highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of lens fit and corneal health.

The consensus aims to standardize practices and improve the safety and effectiveness of orthokeratology, especially for children and adolescents.
