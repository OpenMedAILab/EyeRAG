The "Guideline for Prevention and Control of Clinical Risk in Orthokeratology" (2017) provides essential measures for the safe practice of orthokeratology, a method for temporarily correcting myopia with specialized contact lenses. While effective in improving vision and controlling myopia progression, it poses higher risks of complications. Key recommendations include ensuring qualified personnel for lens fitting, maintaining legally recognized and hygienic facilities, implementing management protocols for records and adverse reactions, educating patients about risks and follow-up care, conducting regular monitoring, and categorizing complications for effective risk management. The guideline advocates for a collaborative approach to minimize risks in orthokeratology.
