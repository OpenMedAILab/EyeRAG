The "Expert Consensus on Preoperative Measurement and Application of Ocular Biological Parameters for Cataract Surgery" highlights the necessity of precise measurement of ocular parameters before cataract surgery to improve postoperative visual outcomes. Developed by ophthalmology experts, it recommends specific techniques and devices for measuring parameters such as axial length, corneal curvature, and optical factors like wavefront aberrations. The consensus aims to standardize preoperative assessments to enhance refractive results and patient satisfaction, emphasizing the use of appropriate devices, standardized protocols, and individual patient considerations.
