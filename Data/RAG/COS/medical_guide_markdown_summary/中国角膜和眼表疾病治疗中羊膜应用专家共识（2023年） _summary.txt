The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Application of Amniotic Membrane in the Treatment of Corneal and Ocular Surface Diseases (2023)" highlights the therapeutic benefits of amniotic membrane (AM), such as promoting healing and reducing inflammation. However, it also addresses challenges like misuse and improper surgical techniques. To standardize AM application, experts have created guidelines covering indications, surgical methods, and perioperative management. The document includes information on AM mechanisms, procurement, contraindications, surgical techniques, postoperative care, and potential complications. The consensus aims to improve clinical practices in treating corneal and ocular surface diseases with AM.
