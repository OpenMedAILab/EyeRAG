The Ophthalmology Branch of the China Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine has developed a consensus on the clinical use of Hexuemingmu tablets for treating wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD). This traditional Chinese medicine, used for over 20 years, has proven effective in improving ocular symptoms and visual function in patients with fundus hemorrhage. The consensus aims to provide guidance on dosage, treatment duration, and safety, emphasizing evidence-based recommendations and expert experience. It details the drug's benefits, appropriate usage, potential side effects, and contraindications, serving as a reference for healthcare professionals. Further high-quality research is needed to refine its clinical application and update guidelines.
