The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Eye Examination Under General Anesthesia for Infants" (2022) provides standardized guidelines for conducting eye examinations under general anesthesia (EUA) in infants aged 0-3 years. Developed by the Ophthalmology Group of the Chinese Pediatric Society, the consensus highlights the importance of EUA in diagnosing blinding conditions such as retinopathy of prematurity, retinoblastoma, and congenital cataracts. It includes detailed protocols for pre-anesthesia assessment, anesthesia management, post-examination care, recommended equipment, and procedures for various eye tests, while emphasizing infection control and documentation. This consensus aims to enhance awareness and improve eye care quality for infants in China.
