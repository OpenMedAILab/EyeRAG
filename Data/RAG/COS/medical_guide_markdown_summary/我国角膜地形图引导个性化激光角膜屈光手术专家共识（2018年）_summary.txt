The "Expert Consensus on Corneal Topography-Guided Personalized Laser Refractive Surgery" (2018) by the Chinese Medical Association builds on a 2015 consensus, advocating for the use of corneal topography in personalized laser ablation to mitigate issues like night vision disturbances. It outlines surgical indications, contraindications, preoperative assessments, data transmission, surgical planning, intraoperative considerations, and postoperative management, aiming to enhance corneal shape and visual quality by effectively addressing low and high-order aberrations with advanced laser techniques.
