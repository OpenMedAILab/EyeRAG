The "Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy with Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine" were created by Chinese endocrinology experts to standardize the management of diabetic retinopathy (DR). They advocate a combined approach that includes traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and evidence-based Western practices. The guidelines cover diagnosis, syndrome differentiation, treatment options (including TCM herbal remedies and modern medications), and rehabilitation strategies, emphasizing patient education and regular eye exams. The goal is to enhance care quality and improve patient outcomes through a holistic management of risk factors.
