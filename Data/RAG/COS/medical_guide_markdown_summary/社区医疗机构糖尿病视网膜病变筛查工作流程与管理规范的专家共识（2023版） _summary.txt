The "Expert Consensus on Workflow and Management of Screening for Diabetic Retinopathy in Primary Healthcare Institutions (2023 Edition)" provides a structured framework for early detection and management of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in community healthcare settings in China. It highlights the importance of early screening to minimize blindness risk, utilizing digital imaging and telemedicine in resource-limited areas. Key components include guidelines for screening protocols using non-mydriatic fundus cameras, classification of healthcare institutions' roles, training programs for providers, referral standards for specialized care, and a data-driven management system for monitoring patients. The consensus aims to enhance DR screening and management, ultimately reducing vision loss among diabetic patients.
