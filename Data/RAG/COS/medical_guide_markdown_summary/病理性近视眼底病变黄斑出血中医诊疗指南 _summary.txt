The "Guidelines for Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis and Treatment of Macular Hemorrhage in Pathological Myopia," issued by the Ophthalmology Branch of the Chinese Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, address the rising incidence of pathological myopia in Asia, which can result in serious complications like macular hemorrhage. The guidelines differentiate between simple hemorrhage and choroidal neovascularization (CNV), with anti-VEGF therapy being the main treatment for CNV, though its effectiveness for simple hemorrhage is uncertain and costly. TCM attributes the condition to deficiencies in the liver, spleen, and kidney, proposing a standardized treatment approach that incorporates evidence-based practices and patient preferences. The guidelines provide diagnostic criteria, treatment principles, preventive measures, and recommend specific herbal formulations, along with a grading system for evidence certainty to improve TCM's application in managing macular hemorrhage.
