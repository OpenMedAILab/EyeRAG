A consensus on pharmaceutical care for intravitreal injection (IVI) drugs was developed by professional committees in China to provide guidance for their clinical use. IVI delivers medications directly into the eye for treating retinal diseases like diabetic macular edema and age-related macular degeneration. The consensus includes characteristics of IVI drugs, pharmaceutical services before, during, and after injection, and offers 26 recommendations to improve safety, efficacy, and treatment adherence. It highlights the pharmacist's role and serves as a resource for healthcare professionals involved in IVI therapy.
