The "Expert Consensus on Preoperative Refraction and Monocular Vision Simulation for Laser Corneal Refractive Surgery in China" establishes standardized procedures for preoperative assessments in laser eye surgeries, focusing on myopia and presbyopia correction. It highlights the need for accurate refraction and vision simulations to improve surgical outcomes and patient comfort, while addressing gaps in current practices. Recommendations include guidelines for refraction methods, assessing the dominant eye, and conducting thorough binocular evaluations. The consensus aims to enhance the personalization of refractive surgery, ultimately boosting patient satisfaction and visual quality post-surgery.
