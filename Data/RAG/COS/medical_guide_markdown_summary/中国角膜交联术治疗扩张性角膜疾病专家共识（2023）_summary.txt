The "Consensus on Corneal Cross-Linking for the Treatment of Corneal Ectasia Disease in China (2023)" provides guidelines for the clinical use of corneal cross-linking (CXL) to treat keratoconus and post-refractive surgery ectasia. It highlights the need for a proper surgical environment, qualified personnel, and detailed preoperative assessments. The document covers indications, contraindications, informed consent, surgical techniques (epithelial-off and epithelial-on), and postoperative management, aiming to standardize CXL practices in China for enhanced patient safety and treatment efficacy. Key funding sources include the Zhejiang Provincial Key Research and Development Program and the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation.
