The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Orbital Foreign Bodies" (2021) highlights the risks of mechanical injury, infections, and severe complications from orbital foreign bodies. Developed by the Oculoplastic and Orbital Disease Group of the Chinese Ophthalmological Society, it aims to standardize diagnosis and treatment practices. Key points include the classification of foreign bodies, the use of imaging techniques (CT, MRI, X-ray) for diagnosis, and treatment principles focused on preventing infections, controlling inflammation, and timely removal. The consensus stresses the importance of careful assessment to avoid misdiagnosis and complications from retained foreign bodies.
