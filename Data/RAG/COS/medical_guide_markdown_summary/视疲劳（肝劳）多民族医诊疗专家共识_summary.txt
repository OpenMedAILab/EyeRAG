The "Expert Consensus on Multi-Ethnic Medical Diagnosis and Treatment of Visual Fatigue" was created by the Ophthalmology Branch of the China Ethnic Medicine Association to address the increasing prevalence of visual fatigue linked to societal development and electronic device use. It emphasizes the benefits of ethnic medicine, which varies by region, and seeks to standardize treatment protocols. The consensus incorporates diagnostic and treatment insights from five ethnic medical systems—Mongolian, Miao, Tibetan, Zhuang, and Traditional Chinese Medicine—highlighting holistic and individualized care. It aims to guide clinicians in improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient quality of life based on evidence and expert experience.
