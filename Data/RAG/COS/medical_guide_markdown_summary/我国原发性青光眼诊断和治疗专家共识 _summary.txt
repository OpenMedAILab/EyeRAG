The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Glaucoma in China" aims to standardize glaucoma diagnosis and treatment, addressing its status as the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. Building on previous guidelines, it highlights essential diagnostic methods such as intraocular pressure measurement and visual field testing. For primary open-angle glaucoma, it specifies diagnostic criteria and treatment options, including medication and surgery. For primary angle-closure glaucoma, it distinguishes between acute and chronic forms, recommends diagnostic tests, and outlines surgical principles. The consensus serves as a guideline to enhance glaucoma management and reduce blindness rates in China.
