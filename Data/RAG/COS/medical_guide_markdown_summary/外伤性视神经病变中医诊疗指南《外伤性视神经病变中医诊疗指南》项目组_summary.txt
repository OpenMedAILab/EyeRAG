The "Guidelines for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Diagnosis and Treatment of Traumatic Optic Neuropathy (TON)" address the rising incidence of TON due to traffic and workplace accidents. They provide standardized TCM treatment protocols that integrate evidence-based practices and patient preferences, applicable across various healthcare settings in China. The guidelines define TON, outline its epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic criteria, and categorize it into acute, subacute, and chronic stages, identifying key TCM syndromes. Treatment recommendations include herbal medicine, proprietary Chinese medicines, and acupuncture, particularly alongside Western treatments, with specific suggestions based on the patient's condition. The guidelines also call for further research and standardization in TCM approaches to TON.
