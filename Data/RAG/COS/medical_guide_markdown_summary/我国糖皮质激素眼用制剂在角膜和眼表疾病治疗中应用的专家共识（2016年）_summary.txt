The 2016 expert consensus from the Chinese Medical Association's Ophthalmology Branch addresses the use of glucocorticoid eye preparations for corneal and ocular surface diseases. While effective in managing eye inflammation, improper use can lead to adverse effects such as prolonged conditions and infection risks. The consensus classifies glucocorticoids by duration of action and indications, including immune-related diseases and post-surgical care, while noting potential side effects like increased intraocular pressure. It stresses the importance of adherence to usage guidelines, contraindications, and monitoring, and provides specific treatment protocols for conditions like allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye, emphasizing careful management and follow-up.
