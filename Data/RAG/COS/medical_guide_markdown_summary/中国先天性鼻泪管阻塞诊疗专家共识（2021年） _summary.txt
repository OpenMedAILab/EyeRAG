The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Diagnosis and Treatment of Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction (CNLDO)" provides guidelines for managing this common pediatric condition, which affects 5-20% of newborns and is characterized by persistent tearing. It highlights the importance of standardized treatment protocols to address issues like improper surgical indications. Diagnosis typically involves lacrimal duct irrigation and fluorescein dye tests. Treatment options range from conservative measures, such as massage and observation, to surgical interventions, including probing and ductal intubation, with a stepwise approach based on age and severity. The consensus aims to enhance clinical practices and outcomes for CNLDO in China.
