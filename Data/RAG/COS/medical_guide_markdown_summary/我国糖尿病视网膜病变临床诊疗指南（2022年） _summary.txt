The "Clinical Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in China (2022)" is an evidence-based document created by the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Medical Doctor Association to address the public health challenge of DR, a leading cause of blindness among working-age individuals in China. With over 140 million diabetics in the country, the guidelines emphasize early detection and management of DR and diabetic macular edema (DME). They recommend updated diagnostic techniques, various treatment options (including anti-VEGF therapies), and systematic diabetes management to prevent DR progression. Key recommendations include regular screening for diabetic patients, evidence-based treatment strategies, and the importance of patient education. The guidelines aim to standardize DR prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in China to improve patient outcomes.
