The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dry Eye (2024)" addresses the rising prevalence of dry eye syndrome, influenced by aging and screen time. Developed by the Cornea Groups of the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Ophthalmologist Association, this updated guideline builds on 2013 recommendations and incorporates recent research. Key points include defining dry eye as a multifactorial disease, noting a global prevalence of 5% to 50% (21% to 52.4% in China), classifying it into types based on tear film abnormalities, and outlining diagnostic methods like tear breakup time and Schirmer tests. Treatment strategies vary by severity and include artificial tears, anti-inflammatory medications, and non-pharmacological interventions, with surgical options for severe cases. The consensus aims to standardize practices and improve patient outcomes in dry eye management.
