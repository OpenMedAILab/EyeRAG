The "Expert Consensus on Perioperative Management of Penetrating Canaloplasty" (2022) provides guidelines for managing patients undergoing a combined canaloplasty and trabeculectomy for glaucoma. Since its introduction in 2015, the procedure has yielded over 900 successful surgeries. The consensus emphasizes a perioperative period of one week before to three months after surgery, highlighting the importance of thorough preoperative assessments and patient education on potential complications, particularly transient intraocular pressure (IOP) spikes. Key recommendations include appropriate surgical indications for all age groups, essential preoperative care to control IOP, intraoperative strategies for addressing challenges, and postoperative monitoring and management of common complications. The goal is to standardize the approach to ensure effective treatment and complication management for glaucoma patients.
