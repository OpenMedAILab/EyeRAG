The 2019 "Expert Consensus on Cycloplegic Refraction and Safe Medication for Chinese Children" highlights the critical role of cycloplegic agents in accurately diagnosing refractive errors in children. While atropine has been the traditional choice in China, newer agents like cyclopentolate are preferred in the West for their quicker effects. The consensus aims to standardize the use of these agents in pediatric care, detailing appropriate concentrations, guidelines for use, and advocating for the development of new formulations to improve clinical practices in China. It underscores the necessity of cycloplegic refraction for reliable assessments, particularly in complex pediatric cases.
