The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Unilateral Intraocular Retinoblastoma in China (2019)" provides guidelines for managing retinoblastoma (RB), the most common intraocular cancer in children, particularly focusing on unilateral cases. Developed by the Chinese Medical Association's Ophthalmology Branch, the consensus aims to standardize treatment across regions with varying healthcare resources. Key points include the prevalence of RB in children under three, early symptoms like leukocoria, diagnostic methods (clinical evaluation, imaging, histopathology), and a staging system (A-E) to guide treatment. Treatment strategies emphasize life preservation, eye retention, and vision preservation through chemotherapy, local therapies, and surgery. Regular follow-up is crucial for monitoring and managing complications, ultimately aiming to enhance clinical outcomes and quality of life for RB patients in China.
