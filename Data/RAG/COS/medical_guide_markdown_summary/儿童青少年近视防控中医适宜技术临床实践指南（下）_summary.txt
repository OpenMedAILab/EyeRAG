The "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Myopia in Children and Adolescents Using Traditional Chinese Medicine" presents various TCM techniques for managing myopia. Key methods include:

1. **Plum Blossom Needle Therapy**: Targets acupoints to improve eye blood circulation and alleviate muscle spasms, effective for early and mild myopia.
2. **Acupoint Massage**: Stimulates acupoints to enhance blood flow and relieve eye strain, though specific efficacy studies are limited.
3. **Gua Sha (Scraping Therapy)**: Recommended alongside other TCM methods to control myopia progression, but may face compliance issues due to its invasive nature.
4. **Dietary Therapy**: Advocates for a nutrient-rich diet to support eye health.
5. **Preventive Measures**: Suggests proper reading posture, screen time management, good lighting, and outdoor activities to reduce myopia risk.

The guidelines stress the importance of professional guidance for safety and compliance.
