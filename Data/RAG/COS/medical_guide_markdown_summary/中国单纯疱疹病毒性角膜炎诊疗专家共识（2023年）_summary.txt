The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Herpes Simplex Keratitis (HSK) 2023" provides standardized guidelines for managing HSK, a viral corneal disease that can cause blindness. Developed by the Ocular Infection Group of the Chinese Ophthalmologist Association, it highlights key aspects such as the clinical characteristics of HSK, diagnostic methods (including PCR), treatment options (antivirals, corticosteroids, and surgery), and prevention strategies to avoid recurrence. The consensus aims to improve clinical management and patient outcomes for HSK in China.
