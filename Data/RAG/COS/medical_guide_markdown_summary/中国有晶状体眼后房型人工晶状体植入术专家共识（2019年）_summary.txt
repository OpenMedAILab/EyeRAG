The "Expert Consensus on Phakic Intraocular Lens Implantation Surgery" (2019) provides guidelines for the use of phakic posterior chamber intraocular lenses in refractive surgery, developed by experts from the Chinese Medical Association's Ophthalmology Branch. It outlines standardized protocols for indications, preoperative assessments, surgical requirements, informed consent, the surgical process, and management of complications. Key recommendations include targeting patients aged 18-45 with stable myopia or astigmatism, conducting thorough preoperative evaluations, ensuring specific surgical qualifications, and addressing potential complications. The consensus aims to serve as a reference for ophthalmologists and will be updated as new clinical insights emerge.
