The "2020 Chinese Glaucoma Guidelines," created by the Glaucoma Group of the Chinese Medical Association and the Ophthalmology Branch of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association, aim to standardize glaucoma diagnosis and treatment in China. Based on recent advancements and international guidelines, they address screening, clinical assessment, and management of various glaucoma types, including primary open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma. Key recommendations include the importance of opportunistic and population-based screening, detailed clinical assessment protocols, tailored treatment strategies based on disease severity, and regular follow-up to monitor intraocular pressure and visual function. The guidelines advocate for personalized treatment plans that consider individual patient factors and allow for updates as new evidence arises.
