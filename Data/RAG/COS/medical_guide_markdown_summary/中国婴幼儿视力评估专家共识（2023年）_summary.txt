The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Visual Acuity Testing for Infants and Preverbal Children (2023)" highlights the necessity of early diagnosis and intervention for visual issues in infants (0-3 years) to prevent permanent impairment. It seeks to establish standardized guidelines for visual acuity evaluation, screening, and follow-up, addressing the challenges posed by infants' limited communication abilities. The consensus promotes collaboration between pediatricians and ophthalmologists to improve early detection and treatment of visual disorders, aiming to standardize practices across China based on comprehensive research and discussions.
