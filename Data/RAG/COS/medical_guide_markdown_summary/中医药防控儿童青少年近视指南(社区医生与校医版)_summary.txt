The "Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Myopia in Children and Adolescents" issued by the Chinese Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine address the increasing rates of myopia in China. They stress the importance of early intervention to prevent severe forms of myopia that can lead to blindness. The guidelines cover the classification, causes, and risk factors of myopia, and advocate for regular vision screenings and eye health records. They promote Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques, such as acupuncture and dietary therapy, and encourage community and school doctors to educate families on preventive measures and healthy visual habits. The overall goal is to mobilize efforts to combat the myopia epidemic among Chinese youth.
