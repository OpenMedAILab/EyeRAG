The "Expert Consensus on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Endophthalmitis After Cataract Surgery in China" (2017) aims to standardize infection control and treatment protocols for endophthalmitis post-cataract surgery. It addresses disparities in infection rates between smaller and larger hospitals, building on previous guidelines from 2010 and 2013. Key recommendations include thorough examinations, bacterial identification, timely vitrectomy for severe cases, and specific antibiotic regimens. Preventive strategies such as topical antibiotics, povidone-iodine disinfection, and intraocular cefuroxime injections are emphasized to reduce infection rates. The consensus seeks to enhance cataract surgery outcomes in China, aligning with international standards while considering local practices.
