The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Management of Eye Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome (2025)" outlines the systemic, age-related disorder known as pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX), which can lead to secondary glaucoma and cataracts. Due to its subtle early symptoms, PEX is often misdiagnosed, risking irreversible vision loss. Developed by clinical experts through a modified Delphi method, the consensus offers standardized recommendations on epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment strategies, and follow-up protocols. It emphasizes the importance of early detection, regular monitoring, and tailored treatment to improve patient outcomes.
