Experts agree that artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in preventing and treating myopia, a growing public health issue affecting over 1 billion people worldwide. AI models can enhance personalized diagnosis, risk assessment, and timely interventions, particularly in children and adults. However, challenges such as data generalization, high costs, and privacy concerns persist. The consensus calls for improved public datasets, infrastructure, and patient education to better integrate AI into clinical practice, ultimately aiming to reduce the global impact of myopia.
