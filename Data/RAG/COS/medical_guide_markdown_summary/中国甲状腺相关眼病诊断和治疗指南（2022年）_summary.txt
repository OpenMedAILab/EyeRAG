The "Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy (TAO) (2022)" were created by the Oculoplastic and Orbital Disease Group and the Thyroid Group in China to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of TAO, an autoimmune disease linked to thyroid disorders that can cause blindness. The guidelines include 24 recommendations covering diagnostic criteria, disease staging, treatment methods, and multidisciplinary management. They emphasize the importance of individualized treatment, active disease staging, and managing associated thyroid conditions and comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension to improve patient outcomes.
