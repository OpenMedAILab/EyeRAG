The Ophthalmic Imaging Group of the Chinese Society of Microcirculation has established a consensus on the standardized practice of fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), a vital diagnostic tool for ocular diseases. This consensus addresses concerns about standardization, safety, and consistency, providing guidelines on FFA conditions, indications, pre-examination preparations, procedures, adverse reaction management, post-examination care, and reporting. The goal is to improve FFA quality and efficiency, minimize adverse reactions, and serve as a reference for clinicians. Key recommendations include ensuring proper facilities, thorough patient assessments, and adherence to specific protocols for optimal imaging results.
