The "Expert Consensus on Corneal Transplantation in China (2015)" provides guidelines for corneal transplantation procedures to restore vision and improve eye appearance. Developed by the Corneal Disease Group of the Chinese Medical Association, it notes the rising number of annual surgeries, approximately 5,000, and outlines various transplant types, including penetrating, lamellar, and endothelial. Key recommendations include thorough patient history assessments, preoperative examinations, careful surgical preparation and technique, regular postoperative follow-ups, and effective management of complications. The consensus aims to enhance clinical practices and optimize the use of limited corneal donor materials in China.
