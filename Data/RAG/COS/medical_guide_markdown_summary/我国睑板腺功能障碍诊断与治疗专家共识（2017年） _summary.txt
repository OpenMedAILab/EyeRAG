The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) in China (2017)" provides guidelines on the clinical features, classification, diagnosis, and treatment of MGD, a prevalent eye condition that can cause dry eye and other issues. MGD is characterized by meibomian gland duct obstruction and abnormal lipid secretion, leading to inflammation and ocular surface damage. It is classified into low and high secretion types, with various risk factors. Symptoms include dryness and discomfort, while diagnosis involves assessing symptoms, signs, and tests. Treatment focuses on addressing underlying causes and includes eyelid hygiene, warm compresses, medications, and possibly surgery. The consensus aims to standardize MGD management in China.
