The "Expert Consensus on the Treatment of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)" provides standardized guidelines for treating ROP, a leading cause of blindness in premature and low birth weight infants. Developed by the Ophthalmology Group of the Pediatrics Society of the Chinese Medical Association, the consensus outlines key treatment methods such as laser therapy, anti-VEGF injections, and vitreoretinal surgery, tailored to the severity of ROP. It highlights the necessity of appropriate medical conditions for treatment and emphasizes the importance of follow-up care to monitor disease progression and prevent retinal detachment.
