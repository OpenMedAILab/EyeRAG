The "Expert Consensus on Staging Public Health Strategies for Myopia Prevention and Control in Children and Adolescents" (2022) addresses the increasing prevalence of myopia in China, proposing a four-stage framework for public health intervention: 

1. **Myopia Prodromal Stage**: Focus on early interventions for children at high risk of developing myopia, such as promoting outdoor activities and reducing near work.
2. **Myopia Development Stage**: Implement comprehensive measures for children with diagnosed myopia progressing over 0.50 D per year, including outdoor activities and corrective treatments.
3. **High Myopia Stage**: Monitor children with significant refractive errors or axial length, emphasizing preventive measures to mitigate complications.
4. **Pathological Myopia Stage**: Involves severe ocular changes requiring close monitoring and possible surgical intervention.

The consensus highlights the need for early risk assessment and tailored strategies to manage myopia effectively and reduce its public health impact among children and adolescents in China.
