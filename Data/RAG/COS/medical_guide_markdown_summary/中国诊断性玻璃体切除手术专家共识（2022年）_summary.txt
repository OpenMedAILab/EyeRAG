The "Chinese Expert Consensus on Diagnostic Vitrectomy for Biopsy (2022)" provides guidelines for performing diagnostic vitrectomy in unexplained vitreous or retinal choroidal diseases. Developed by experts from the Ocular Oncology Committee and the Ophthalmological Society of China, it emphasizes proper indications, surgical techniques, specimen handling, and postoperative management. The consensus advocates for minimally invasive vitrectomy over traditional needle biopsy, particularly in challenging diagnostic cases, and underscores the importance of clinical evaluation and communication among healthcare professionals to ensure safety and effectiveness.
