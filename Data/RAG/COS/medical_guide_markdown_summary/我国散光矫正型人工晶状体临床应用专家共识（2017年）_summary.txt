The "Expert Consensus on the Clinical Application of Astigmatism-Correcting Intraocular Lenses (IOLs) in China (2017)" highlights the shift in cataract surgery from preventing blindness to improving visual quality, particularly through the use of Toric IOLs to correct corneal astigmatism. Key points include the definition and types of astigmatism, indications for Toric IOLs (suitable for regular astigmatism ≥0.75 D), the importance of accurate preoperative measurements, precise surgical techniques for IOL placement, and postoperative follow-up to monitor outcomes. The consensus aims to standardize Toric IOL use to enhance visual outcomes for cataract patients.
