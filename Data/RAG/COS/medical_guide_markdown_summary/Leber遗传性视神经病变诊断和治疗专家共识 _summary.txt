Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited condition caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations, leading to retinal ganglion cell degeneration and vision loss, primarily in young males. Diagnosis involves recognizing acute or subacute painless vision loss, confirming pathogenic mutations through genetic testing, and ruling out other optic neuropathies. Currently, there is no definitive treatment; supportive care includes low vision aids and lifestyle changes. Idebenone shows some promise, while gene and stem cell therapies are under investigation. Prognosis is generally poor, with many patients achieving low visual acuity, though early treatment may improve outcomes.
