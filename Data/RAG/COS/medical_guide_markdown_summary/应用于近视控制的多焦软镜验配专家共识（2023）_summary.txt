The "Expert Consensus on Multifocal Soft Contact Lens Fitting for Myopia Control (2023)" provides guidelines for using multifocal soft contact lenses (MFCLs) to manage myopia in children and adolescents, a growing global health concern. The consensus highlights the effectiveness of MFCLs in slowing myopia progression by 25% to 50% through peripheral defocus. It details the mechanisms, designs (concentric bifocal and progressive multifocal), and clinical efficacy of MFCLs, along with indications, contraindications, and a fitting process that includes patient assessment and monitoring. Emphasizing individualized treatment plans and the need for ongoing research, the document positions MFCLs as a promising option for myopia control in younger populations.
