The expert consensus on axial length (AL) in myopia management highlights its non-invasive measurement as essential for evaluating refractive status in children and adolescents. While AL is a key indicator for myopia control, there is a need for standardized reference values and measurement protocols in China. The consensus provides recommendations for public health practitioners to enhance myopia prevention strategies, emphasizing the importance of monitoring AL growth, which is linked to refractive changes. It proposes safety growth values and conversion relationships between AL changes and refractive error, aiming to improve myopia prevention and control through tailored management strategies.
