The "2020 Clinical Application Guidelines for Traditional Chinese Medicine in Treating Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)" address the rising prevalence of AMD, especially in the elderly, and the limitations of current Western treatments like anti-VEGF injections. The guidelines aim to integrate traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with modern practices to improve treatment outcomes and patient quality of life. Developed through expert consultations and literature reviews, they recommend three TCM products—Zhi Xue Qu Yu Ming Mu Pian, He Xue Ming Mu Pian, and Fu Fang Xue Zhan Tong Jiao Nang—based on clinical evidence. The guidelines call for further high-quality research to enhance the evidence base for TCM in AMD treatment and will be updated every 3-5 years. Limitations include the low quality of existing studies and the need for better outcome measures.
