The expert consensus on low vision rehabilitation for macular disease patients in China highlights the importance of leveraging residual visual function to enhance quality of life. While current medical technologies cannot restore lost macular function, training can help patients establish stable paracentral fixation points. The consensus provides a standard operating procedure for visual training, emphasizing comprehensive assessments of visual function, disease stability, and quality of life prior to training. Techniques such as microperimetry and biofeedback are recommended to develop a new preferred retinal locus (PRL), improving visual acuity and stability.
