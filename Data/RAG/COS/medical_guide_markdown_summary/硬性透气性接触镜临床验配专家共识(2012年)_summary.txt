The "Expert Consensus on the Clinical Fitting of Rigid Gas Permeable Contact Lenses" (2012) by the Chinese Medical Association provides guidelines for fitting rigid gas permeable contact lenses (RGPCL) and orthokeratology lenses (OK). These lenses are classified as Class III medical devices and require adherence to specific protocols for safety and effectiveness. 

Key points include:

1. **Indications and Contraindications**: RGP lenses are suitable for various refractive errors and conditions, while contraindications include active ocular diseases and high sensitivity. Orthokeratology lenses are indicated for myopia and regular astigmatism, particularly in children, with similar contraindications.

2. **Fitting Process**: The fitting process involves patient education, comprehensive eye health checks, and careful selection of lens types based on individual assessments. Orthokeratology fitting requires additional tests like corneal topography.

The consensus aims to standardize fitting practices to improve the safety and effectiveness of these lenses in clinical settings.
