The "Expert Consensus on Endoscopic Dacryocystorhinostomy for Chronic Dacryocystitis" (2020) highlights the rising incidence of chronic dacryocystitis, marked by persistent tearing and discharge. Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (En-DCR) has become the preferred surgical method due to its advantages over traditional techniques, including less scarring and the ability to treat nasal issues. However, challenges such as improper indications and complications persist. The consensus aims to standardize treatment protocols, focusing on disease understanding, patient selection, surgical procedures, postoperative care, and complication management to improve clinical outcomes.
