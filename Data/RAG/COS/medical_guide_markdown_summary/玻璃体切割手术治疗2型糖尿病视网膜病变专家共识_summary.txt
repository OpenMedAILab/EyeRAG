The "Expert Consensus on Pars Plana Vitrectomy for Treating Type 2 Diabetic Retinopathy" provides guidelines for managing proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), emphasizing timely surgical intervention through pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) to prevent vision loss. Key recommendations include early PPV for patients with vitreous hemorrhage, maintaining perioperative blood glucose levels between 6.0 to 10.0 mmol/L, using anti-VEGF agents to enhance recovery, prioritizing safe membrane removal techniques, selecting intraocular tamponade based on retinal tears, and considering combined cataract surgery when necessary. The consensus aims to improve care for PDR patients in China and encourages further research to validate these guidelines.
