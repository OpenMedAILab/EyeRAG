The "Experts' Consensus on Visual Quality Evaluation after Refractive Surgery" emphasizes the need for comprehensive assessment of visual quality post-surgery, beyond just visual acuity. Developed by experts from the Chinese Optometric Association and the Chinese Ophthalmological Society, it advocates for a combination of subjective methods (like visual acuity tests and quality of life questionnaires) and objective methods (such as wavefront aberration analysis) to enhance patient comfort and satisfaction. The consensus also highlights the importance of addressing potential binocular vision issues to improve clinical practices and patient outcomes in refractive surgery.
