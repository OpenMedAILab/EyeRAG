The "Boao Declaration 3.0," released by the Chinese Medical Association and others, builds on earlier declarations to enhance myopia prevention and control in China, especially post-COVID-19. It advocates for integrating myopia prevention into national health strategies and includes key recommendations such as establishing a national myopia prevention agency, creating healthier environments, enhancing screening and data management, focusing on early intervention for young children, addressing severe myopia, standardizing treatment, promoting public education, and advancing research on myopia. The goal is to implement a comprehensive approach to prevent myopia in children and adolescents.
