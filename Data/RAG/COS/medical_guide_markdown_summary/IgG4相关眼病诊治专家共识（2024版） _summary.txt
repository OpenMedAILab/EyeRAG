The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Immunoglobulin-G4 Related Ophthalmic Disease (2024 Edition)" provides guidelines for managing IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD), an immune-mediated condition marked by ocular mass lesions and elevated IgG4 levels. Developed by experts from the Chinese Ophthalmological Society and the Chinese Rheumatology Association, the consensus emphasizes multidisciplinary collaboration due to the disease's complexity. Key diagnostic criteria include ocular imaging, serum IgG4 levels, and histopathology. First-line treatment involves glucocorticoids, with immunosuppressants and biologics as second-line options. Surgical intervention may be necessary in severe cases. The consensus also stresses the need for systemic screening and regular follow-up to monitor for recurrence and malignancy, aiming to standardize care and enhance patient outcomes.
