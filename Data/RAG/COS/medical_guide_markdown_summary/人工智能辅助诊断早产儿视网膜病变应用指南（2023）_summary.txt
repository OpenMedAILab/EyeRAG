The "2023 Guidelines for AI-Assisted Diagnosis of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)" emphasize the rising incidence of ROP in preterm infants and the urgent need for early screening due to the disease's rapid progression. The guidelines highlight advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and deep learning, which enhance diagnostic accuracy through technologies like computer-based image analysis and convolutional neural networks. Challenges in implementing AI include standardizing data collection, variability in imaging equipment, and integrating AI into clinical workflows, alongside ethical considerations. Future directions aim to improve screening processes, automate image analysis, and refine treatment guidelines to reduce preventable blindness in infants by enhancing diagnostic efficiency and addressing logistical and ethical challenges.
