The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Orbital Blowout Fractures" (2014) by the Chinese Medical Association defines orbital blowout fractures as fractures of the orbital walls without rim involvement, often resulting from blunt force trauma. These fractures can lead to complications such as enophthalmos, diplopia, and sensory disturbances. The consensus highlights the rising incidence of these injuries in China and the need for standardized diagnostic and treatment protocols to reduce misdiagnosis and improve outcomes. Key points include the importance of thorough ocular examinations and CT imaging for diagnosis, a range of treatment options from medication to surgery, and the necessity for careful monitoring of potential post-surgical complications. The consensus aims to enhance clinical management and patient care for those affected by orbital blowout fractures.
