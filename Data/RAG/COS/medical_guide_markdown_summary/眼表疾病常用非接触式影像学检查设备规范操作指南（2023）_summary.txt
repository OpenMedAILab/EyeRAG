The "Guidelines for Standard Operation of Non-Contact Imaging Devices for Ocular Surface Diseases (2023)" detail the use of non-invasive imaging techniques, such as slit lamp photography, non-contact ocular surface analyzers, AS-OCT, and corneal topography, for diagnosing and managing ocular surface diseases like dry eye and keratitis. The guidelines stress the need for standardized operation to reduce variability in results and provide comprehensive descriptions of each method, including their principles and clinical applications. Additionally, the document highlights the increasing role of artificial intelligence and image processing in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes.
