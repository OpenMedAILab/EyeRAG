The "Guidelines for the Application of Fundus Autofluorescence in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (2023)" provide a framework for using fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging in diagnosing and monitoring age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). FAF is a non-invasive technique that highlights key retinal components, aiding in the identification of early disease signs and differentiating between non-neovascular and neovascular ARMD. The guidelines emphasize the correlation between FAF patterns and disease progression, underscoring its role in evaluating retinal pigment epithelium function and informing treatment decisions. The authors call for further research to improve FAF's application in ARMD management.
