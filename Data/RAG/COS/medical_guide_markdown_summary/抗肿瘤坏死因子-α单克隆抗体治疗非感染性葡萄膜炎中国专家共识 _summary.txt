The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Treatment of Non-Infectious Uveitis with Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Monoclonal Antibodies" recommends the use of Adalimumab and Infliximab as effective second-line treatments for refractory non-infectious uveitis (NIU). In severe cases, these biologics may be considered first-line options. The consensus, developed by the Ocular Immunology Group, emphasizes individualized treatment plans based on patient-specific factors and the importance of regular monitoring for efficacy and safety. It also calls for further research on additional anti-TNF-α agents like Golimumab and Certolizumab Pegol to enhance treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.
