The 2017 expert consensus on primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in China emphasizes the importance of the ocular-cranial pressure gradient, highlighting that low intracranial pressure (ICP) may be a risk factor for normal-tension glaucoma. Key points include the association of low body mass index (BMI) with low ICP, the necessity of considering both intraocular pressure (IOP) and ICP for glaucoma classification, and the potential of non-invasive ICP measurement techniques like MRI. Additionally, lifestyle changes may help increase ICP and reduce the pressure gradient, potentially mitigating optic nerve damage. The consensus calls for further research to enhance early diagnosis and personalized treatment for POAG.
