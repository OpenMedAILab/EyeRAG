The 2022 expert consensus on intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy for meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) highlights IPL as an effective treatment for MGD and related dry eye symptoms. It improves the microenvironment of the meibomian glands, reduces inflammation, and enhances tear film stability. However, there are no standardized guidelines for its clinical application, prompting the need for personalized treatment approaches. The consensus provides recommendations on IPL mechanisms, procedures, and treatment regimens, while also addressing potential adverse effects and the importance of eye protection. It aims to guide future research and the integration of IPL into dry eye management strategies in China.
