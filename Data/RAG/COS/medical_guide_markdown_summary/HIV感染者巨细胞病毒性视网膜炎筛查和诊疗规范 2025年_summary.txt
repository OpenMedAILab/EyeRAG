The "Guidelines for Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Cytomegalovirus Retinitis (CMVR) in HIV-Infected Patients (2025)" were created by the China Alliance for Rare Diseases and the Beijing Society of Rare Disease Clinical Care to address the high risk of CMVR, a major cause of blindness in HIV-infected individuals. The guidelines advocate for a standardized management approach that includes regular eye screenings for high-risk groups, clinical diagnosis supported by CMV-DNA testing, immediate systemic antiviral treatment, and continuous follow-up to monitor complications. The goal is to reduce blindness rates and enhance the quality of life for affected patients.
