The "Guidelines for the Application of AI Screening Systems for Diabetic Retinopathy Based on Fundus Photography," published in August 2019 by the Chinese Medical Education Association, aim to standardize AI-assisted screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) in China. They address hardware requirements, data collection standards, algorithm evaluation, and clinical application processes to enhance early detection and improve screening rates, which are currently low due to resource distribution and specialist shortages. The guidelines emphasize the role of AI in increasing screening accuracy and outline requirements for training datasets, algorithm validation, and follow-up protocols, ensuring that AI diagnoses are confirmed by qualified ophthalmologists. Data security and patient privacy are also prioritized in the implementation of these AI systems.
