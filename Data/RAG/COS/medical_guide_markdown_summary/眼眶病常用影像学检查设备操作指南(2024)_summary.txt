The "Guidelines for the Operation of Imaging Equipment in Orbital Diseases (2024)" outline essential imaging techniques for diagnosing orbital diseases, which affect the orbital bones and surrounding tissues. Conventional ophthalmic exams are often inadequate, making imaging modalities like ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) crucial. The guidelines aim to standardize imaging practices, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and reduce misdiagnoses by detailing the principles and procedures of these techniques. Key imaging methods include ultrasonography (various modes), CT (detailed soft tissue and bone imaging), and MRI (high-resolution soft tissue imaging without radiation). The guidelines also cover the interpretation of imaging findings related to conditions such as thyroid-related eye disease, tumors, and trauma, advocating for a multidisciplinary approach to improve understanding and management of orbital diseases.
