The "Expert Consensus on Microcatheter-Assisted 360° Trabeculotomy" (2017) by the Glaucoma Group of the Chinese Ophthalmological Society presents a new surgical technique for treating primary congenital glaucoma, which is caused by abnormal eye drainage development. Unlike the traditional external trabeculotomy, which has limitations in incision scope and clarity, the microcatheter-assisted 360° trabeculotomy allows for a complete incision of the Schlemm canal under direct visualization, reducing complications. The consensus details the procedure's indications, surgical steps, and aims to standardize treatment approaches for this condition in China.
