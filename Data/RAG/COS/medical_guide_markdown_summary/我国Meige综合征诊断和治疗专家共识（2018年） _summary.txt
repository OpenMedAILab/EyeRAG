The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Meige Syndrome in China (2018)" details the characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of Meige Syndrome, a condition marked by eyelid spasms and lower facial muscle tension, typically starting around age 60 and more common in females. While the exact cause is unknown, psychological stress and medications may play a role. Symptoms include eyelid spasms, eye discomfort, and potential facial and throat muscle involvement, complicating speech and breathing. Diagnosis relies on clinical features, with no specific tests available. Treatment focuses on symptom management through oral medications, botulinum toxin injections, and, in severe cases, deep brain stimulation (DBS). The consensus aims to enhance clinical practice and research for managing the syndrome.
