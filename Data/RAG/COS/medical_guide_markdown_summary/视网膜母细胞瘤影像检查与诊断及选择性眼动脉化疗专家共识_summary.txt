The expert consensus on imaging and selective ophthalmic artery infusion (SOAI) for retinoblastoma (RB) highlights the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment to enhance survival rates in this pediatric eye cancer. Key imaging techniques like ultrasound, CT, and MRI are essential for diagnosis and treatment planning. SOAI is recommended as a first-line treatment for advanced intraocular RB, promoting eye preservation and vision recovery. The consensus provides guidelines on imaging indications, methods, and SOAI protocols, including contraindications and complication management, to standardize practices and improve patient outcomes.
