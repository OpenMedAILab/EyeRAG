The "Guidelines for Standard Operation of Common Glaucoma Examination Equipment (2023)" by the Chinese Medical Education Association emphasizes the critical need for accurate glaucoma diagnosis and management to prevent irreversible blindness. It advocates for standardized examination procedures, including intraocular pressure measurement, anterior chamber angle assessment, optic nerve evaluation, and visual field testing. The guidelines provide detailed protocols for techniques such as tonometry, gonioscopy, and optical coherence tomography (OCT), aiming to enhance ophthalmologists' skills, particularly those specializing in glaucoma. Early diagnosis and treatment are underscored as vital for preventing blindness.
