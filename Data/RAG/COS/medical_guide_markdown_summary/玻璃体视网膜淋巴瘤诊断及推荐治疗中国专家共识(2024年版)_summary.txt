The "2024 Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Recommended Treatment of Vitreoretinal Lymphoma (VRL)" was published in March 2024, outlining guidelines for this rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can cause severe visual impairment. The consensus categorizes VRL as primary or secondary, highlights the non-specific clinical symptoms that often lead to misdiagnosis, and emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach, including imaging and fluid analysis. Treatment strategies involve both ocular and systemic methods, such as intravitreal chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with a focus on continuous monitoring to improve patient outcomes and manage recurrences. The goal is to standardize diagnosis and enhance clinical management of VRL in China.
