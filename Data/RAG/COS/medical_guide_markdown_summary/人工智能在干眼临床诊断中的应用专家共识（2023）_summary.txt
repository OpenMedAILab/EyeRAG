The 2023 expert consensus on artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing dry eye (DE) highlights the condition's rising prevalence and the potential of AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), to improve diagnostic accuracy. Developed by ophthalmology experts, the consensus outlines key AI applications, including analyzing tear break-up time, tear film interference, meibomian gland imaging, tear osmolarity, optical coherence tomography, proteomics, blink detection, and in vivo confocal microscopy. These technologies can objectively assess patient data and medical images to aid in diagnosis, severity classification, and prognosis. The consensus calls for further research and validation of AI systems to ensure their effectiveness in clinical settings.
