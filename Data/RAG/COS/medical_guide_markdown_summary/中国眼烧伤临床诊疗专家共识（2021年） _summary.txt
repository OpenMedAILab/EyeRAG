The "Expert Consensus on the Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Eye Burns in China (2021)" was created by the Cornea Group of the Chinese Medical Association to establish standardized guidelines for managing eye burns caused by chemical or thermal sources. It addresses definitions, epidemiology, classification, severity grading, and treatment principles. Eye burns are categorized into three phases: acute, coexistence of injury and repair, and stable. Key treatment strategies include immediate irrigation, anti-inflammatory medications, and surgical interventions as needed. The consensus highlights the importance of prompt and effective treatment to enhance patient outcomes and minimize complications, serving as a comprehensive resource for ophthalmologists.
