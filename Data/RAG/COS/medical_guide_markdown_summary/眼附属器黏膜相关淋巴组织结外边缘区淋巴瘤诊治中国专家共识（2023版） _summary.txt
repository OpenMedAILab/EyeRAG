The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Management of Ocular Adnexal Extranodal Marginal Zone Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma (2023 Edition)" provides standardized guidelines for diagnosing and treating ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma, a malignant tumor increasingly prevalent in aging populations. Key points include its primary impact on the eyelids, conjunctiva, lacrimal glands, and orbits, with a median age of 45-60 years and a higher prevalence in males. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, imaging, and pathological examination, while treatment varies by disease stage, ranging from surgery and radiation for localized cases to systemic therapies for advanced cases. The consensus underscores the need for multidisciplinary collaboration and ongoing patient monitoring, serving as a vital resource for healthcare professionals to enhance patient outcomes.
