The "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Demodex Blepharitis in China" (2018) provides a comprehensive overview of Demodex blepharitis, a chronic inflammatory condition caused by Demodex mites affecting eyelid margins. Key points include its definition as an inflammation characterized by symptoms like itching and discharge, the etiology involving two mite types (D. folliculorum and D. brevis), and a high prevalence in older populations. The condition is classified into anterior, posterior, and mixed blepharitis, with pathogenesis linked to tissue damage and immune responses. Diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms and mite examination, while treatment focuses on mite eradication through hygiene and medications, with a holistic approach recommended for severe cases.
