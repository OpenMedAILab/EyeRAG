The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Fuchs Uveitis Syndrome" (2022) provides guidelines for diagnosing and treating Fuchs uveitis syndrome, a chronic, unilateral anterior uveitis often misdiagnosed due to unclear etiology. Key features include mild anterior chamber inflammation and diffuse iris depigmentation, with diagnosis based on clinical criteria rather than lab tests. The consensus emphasizes careful monitoring and limited use of corticosteroids, with surgical options for cataracts or glaucoma as necessary. Effective management leads to a generally good visual prognosis.
