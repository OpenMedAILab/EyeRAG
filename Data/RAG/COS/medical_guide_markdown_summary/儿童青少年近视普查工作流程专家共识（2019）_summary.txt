The "Expert Consensus on Workflow for Myopia Screening in Children and Adolescents" (2019) establishes a standardized process for myopia screening in Chinese students under 18, as part of a national strategy to combat myopia. Key components include standardized data collection, structured vision testing, automated refraction measurement, public education on eye health, and a follow-up protocol for those with abnormal results. The consensus aims to promote a systematic and effective approach to myopia prevention and control among youth in China.
