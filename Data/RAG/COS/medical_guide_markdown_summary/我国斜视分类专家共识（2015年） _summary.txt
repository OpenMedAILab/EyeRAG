The "Expert Consensus on Strabismus Classification in China (2015)" by the Chinese Medical Association addresses the prevalence of strabismus (approximately 3%) and the confusion caused by inconsistent classification systems. It proposes a standardized classification based on fusion status, categorizing strabismus into latent (phoria) and manifest (tropia) types, with further distinctions based on eye position, movement, and angle. The classification includes congenital, accommodative, non-accommodative, secondary strabismus, and special types, aiming to standardize clinical practices and reduce ambiguity in strabismus management.
