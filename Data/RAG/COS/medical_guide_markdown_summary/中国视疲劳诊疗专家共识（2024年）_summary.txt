The "Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthenopia (2024)" presents a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing asthenopia, a syndrome marked by eye discomfort and visual disturbances, particularly prevalent among high-screen-time populations, including children. Developed by experts from the Chinese Optometric and Ophthalmologist Associations, the consensus notes a significant rise in asthenopia rates, from 10-20% pre-pandemic to 50-65% during the pandemic. Key factors contributing to the condition include ocular issues, age-related changes, psychological stress, and environmental conditions. Diagnosis involves subjective symptom assessments and ocular health evaluations, while treatment focuses on correcting underlying causes, ergonomic adjustments, and symptomatic relief. Regular follow-up is emphasized for effective management, aiming to provide updated guidelines for clinicians based on recent research and practices.
