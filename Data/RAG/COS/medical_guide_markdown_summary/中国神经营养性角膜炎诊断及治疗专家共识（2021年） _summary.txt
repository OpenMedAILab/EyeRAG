The "Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Neurotrophic Keratitis in China (2021)" was created by the Cornea Group of the Chinese Medical Association to address neurotrophic keratitis (NK), a degenerative corneal disease resulting from trigeminal nerve damage. Common causes include herpes infections, surgical injuries, and diabetes, leading to symptoms like dry eyes and corneal ulcers. The consensus emphasizes accurate diagnosis through patient history and clinical signs, and outlines treatment strategies that vary by disease stage, focusing on restoring nerve function and promoting healing. Emerging therapies, such as nerve growth factor eye drops, show promise. This document serves as a clinical reference for ophthalmologists to improve NK management.
