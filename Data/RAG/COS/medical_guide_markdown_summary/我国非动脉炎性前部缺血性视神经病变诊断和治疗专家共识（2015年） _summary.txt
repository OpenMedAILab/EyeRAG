The 2015 expert consensus in China on non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-AION) identifies it as a common cause of vision loss in individuals over 45, characterized by sudden, painless vision impairment due to optic nerve head ischemia. Diagnosis involves assessing symptoms, visual field defects, and optic disc changes. Treatment includes systemic corticosteroids within two weeks of onset to improve vision and manage risk factors like hypertension and diabetes. Prognosis varies, with many patients experiencing some vision improvement over time.
