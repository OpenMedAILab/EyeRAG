The "Expert Consensus on Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO) in China" highlights CRAO as a critical neuro-ophthalmic emergency that can lead to significant vision loss and increased risks of vascular events. It calls for standardized clinical management tailored to China's healthcare system, addressing disparities in treatment approaches. The guidelines cover various aspects of CRAO, including epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic methods, and treatment options such as thrombolysis and intra-arterial therapy. Emphasizing timely referral to stroke centers and the principle of "time is vision," the consensus advocates for individualized treatment, rapid assessment, and multidisciplinary collaboration to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications in CRAO management in China.
