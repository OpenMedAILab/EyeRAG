The "Expert Consensus on Healthy Lighting for Children's Rooms" (2024) by the Ophthalmology Committee of the China Medical Equipment Association highlights the critical role of appropriate lighting in children's visual development and health. It addresses the lack of guidance for home lighting, focusing on factors such as light sources (natural vs. artificial), layout design, and control systems. While natural light is preferred, full-spectrum LEDs are recommended for their low blue light and high color rendering. The consensus advocates for designated areas in children's rooms for rest, study, and play, with specific brightness and uniformity standards. Smart lighting systems that adapt to natural light and support circadian rhythms are encouraged to enhance well-being and reduce myopia risk, with recommended parameters for various functional areas to ensure visual comfort and health.
