Expert recommendations for goniosynechialysis (GSL) in primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) stress standardized surgical protocols to improve efficacy and reduce complications. GSL, part of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), aims to separate iris tissue from the angle to restore drainage and lower intraocular pressure. Key recommendations include indications for GSL, anesthesia, surgical site selection, procedural steps, separation range, combined techniques, and perioperative medication. The use of a large nucleus hook and viscoelastic agents is advocated for effective separation, promoting a unified approach to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life.
