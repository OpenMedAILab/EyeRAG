The American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines to improve cataract management and eye care quality. These evidence-based guidelines provide a framework for ophthalmologists, emphasizing informed patient consent, thorough preoperative evaluations, and advanced surgical techniques. Key recommendations include recognizing cataracts as a surgical condition, the limited role of dietary supplements, and the necessity of surgery when visual impairment affects quality of life. The guidelines also cover complication management, postoperative care, and the importance of continuous education for ophthalmologists. They address cataract prevalence, risk factors, and the cost-effectiveness of surgery, with a commitment to ongoing research and regular updates to reflect best practices.
