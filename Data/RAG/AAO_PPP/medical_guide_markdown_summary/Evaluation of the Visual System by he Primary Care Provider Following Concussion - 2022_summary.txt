The clinical report "Evaluation of the Visual System by the Primary Care Provider Following Concussion" highlights the critical role of pediatricians in identifying and assessing visual issues in children post-concussion, which can impact their quality of life. It details assessment techniques for visual acuity, pupillary response, visual fields, and eye movements, and offers guidance on recognizing ocular trauma and conditions like strabismus. The recommendations aim to enhance clinical management and ensure a safe return to activities for affected children, developed collaboratively by experts from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
