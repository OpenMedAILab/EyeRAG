The American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines to improve eye care quality, particularly for dry eye syndrome. These guidelines, based on scientific evidence and expert consensus, serve as a framework for clinical practice, emphasizing personalized treatment rather than strict protocols. They cover diagnosis, prevalence, risk factors, and management strategies, which range from education and environmental changes to pharmacological and surgical options for severe cases. The guidelines also stress the importance of ongoing education, ethical considerations, and patient involvement in care, and are regularly updated to incorporate new evidence and practices.
