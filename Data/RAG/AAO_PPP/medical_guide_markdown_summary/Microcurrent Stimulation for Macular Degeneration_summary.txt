The "Complementary Therapy Assessment" from March 2004 evaluates microcurrent stimulation for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which involves applying low electrical currents to the macula. While some studies suggest potential visual improvements, the Task Force concludes there is insufficient scientific evidence to support its effectiveness compared to standard treatments. The report calls for larger, well-designed studies and notes low risks but potentially high costs. Patients are advised to check the treatment's FDA status and its comparative benefits. Overall, the assessment underscores the need for rigorous evaluation of complementary therapies in eye care.
