The report examines the use of Remote Digital Fundus Imaging (RDFI-TM) for assessing Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) in premature infants, addressing challenges in timely diagnosis due to a lack of qualified ophthalmologists and remote NICU locations. RDFI-TM enables the electronic capture and transmission of retinal images for remote evaluation, potentially enhancing access to care and diagnostic accuracy. While effective in identifying infants needing further examination, RDFI-TM should complement, not replace, traditional bedside methods. The report calls for standardized protocols, training, and risk management to ensure safe implementation, along with future research to validate its clinical and cost-effectiveness.
