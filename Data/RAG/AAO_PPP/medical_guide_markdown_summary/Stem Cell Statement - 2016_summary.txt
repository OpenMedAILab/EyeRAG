Intraocular stem cell therapy shows potential for treating retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, with ongoing Phase I/II trials investigating different stem cell sources and delivery methods. However, challenges related to safety and efficacy persist. Some U.S. clinics offer unapproved therapies using adipose-derived stem cells, which lack FDA approval and may pose risks. The FDA is regulating these practices to safeguard public health, while the Academy supports continued oversight to ensure patient safety and treatment effectiveness.
