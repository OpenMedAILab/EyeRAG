The American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines to improve eye care for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These evidence-based guidelines serve as a framework for clinical practice, emphasizing personalized treatment rather than strict protocols. They address risk factors, diagnosis, and management strategies, particularly for neovascular AMD, which causes significant vision loss. Key recommendations include smoking cessation, antioxidant supplements for certain AMD stages, and anti-VEGF therapies as first-line treatments. The guidelines also stress the importance of ongoing education for healthcare providers and patients, along with ethical considerations in ophthalmic practice, and are regularly updated to reflect the latest research.
