The American Academy of Ophthalmology's June 2014 assessment found no scientific evidence supporting marijuana's effectiveness in treating glaucoma compared to existing medications. While it may temporarily lower intraocular pressure, the risks, such as increased heart rate and adverse effects, outweigh the benefits. The unclear mechanism of action and legal complications further hinder its medical use. The report calls for more research on cannabinoids and complementary therapies, concluding that current pharmaceutical treatments are safer and more effective for glaucoma management.
