The "Primary Angle Closure Disease Preferred Practice Pattern" provides guidelines for the classification, treatment, and management of Primary Angle Closure Disease (PACD), which includes PACS, PAC, PACG, and AACC. Key risk factors are Asian descent, hyperopia, older age, and female gender. The primary treatment is laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) to relieve pupillary block. Accurate diagnosis via gonioscopy and medical management to reduce intraocular pressure during AACC are emphasized. Ongoing patient education and follow-up care are crucial for effective disease management. These guidelines from the American Academy of Ophthalmology aim to improve eye care quality but should be tailored to individual patient needs.
