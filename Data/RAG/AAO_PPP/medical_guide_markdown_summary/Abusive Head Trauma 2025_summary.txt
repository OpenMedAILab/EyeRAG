The technical report on Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) in infants and children provides an in-depth analysis of its diagnosis, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, and management. AHT, caused by inflicted blunt impact or violent shaking, is a leading cause of severe head injury in children under 5, with an incidence of 25 to 35 cases per 100,000 annually in the U.S. Key risk factors include young maternal age, low birth weight, and caregiver stress, with male caregivers as the primary perpetrators. Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, but physical findings like retinal hemorrhages and subdural hematomas are more common in AHT cases. Management involves a multidisciplinary approach, addressing both medical and surgical needs, while long-term outcomes can include cognitive and behavioral impairments. Prevention efforts focus on educating caregivers about the risks of shaking and normal infant behavior, though effective reductions in AHT rates have been difficult to achieve.
