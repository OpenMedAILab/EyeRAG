The commentary highlights the necessity of standardizing clinical endpoint reporting in minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), which is known for its low trauma and safety. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends using the cumulative probability of surgical success at 2 years as the primary efficacy endpoint, defining success as achieving an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 21 mmHg or less with a 20% reduction from baseline, without increasing medications or needing further surgeries. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is proposed at 50% for standalone MIGS and 65% for MIGS combined with cataract extraction. The commentary stresses the importance of clear definitions of success and failure, adherence to reporting guidelines, and the role of IOP reduction in glaucoma management, which is crucial given its status as a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Overall, while MIGS is a safer alternative to traditional surgeries, it may be less effective in reducing IOP.
