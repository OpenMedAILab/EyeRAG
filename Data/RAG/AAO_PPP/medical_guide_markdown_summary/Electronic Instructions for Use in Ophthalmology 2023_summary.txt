The multisociety policy statement advocates for the use of electronic instructions for use (e-IFU) in ophthalmic surgery to reduce waste and environmental impact from traditional printed instructions. While regulatory agencies like the EU and FDA allow e-IFU, many countries still mandate printed versions, limiting implementation. The statement highlights benefits such as easier access to updates, reduced packaging weight, and lower shipping costs, particularly for intraocular lenses (IOLs). The authors urge the ophthalmic surgical industry and regulatory bodies to support the transition to e-IFU to minimize waste and carbon emissions.
