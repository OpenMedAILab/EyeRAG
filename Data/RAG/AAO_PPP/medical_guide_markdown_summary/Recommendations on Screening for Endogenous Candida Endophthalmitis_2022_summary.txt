The American Academy of Ophthalmology has determined that routine screening for endogenous Candida endophthalmitis in patients with Candida septicemia is unnecessary, as the incidence is less than 1%. Previous guidelines were based on outdated evidence. The Academy recommends ophthalmologic consultations only when ocular symptoms are present, emphasizing the need to manage the underlying Candida infection and associated comorbidities instead of incidental ocular findings. This position statement aims to promote evidence-based practices in ophthalmology.
