The American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines to improve eye care quality through scientific evidence and expert consensus, focusing on refractive errors like myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. Key recommendations include promoting outdoor activities to reduce myopia, using low-concentration atropine for myopia control, and advocating for daily disposable contact lenses to lower infection risks. The guidelines stress individualized patient care, thorough evaluations, and informed discussions about treatment options, while addressing the global impact of uncorrected refractive errors on quality of life and productivity. Regular updates ensure the guidelines remain relevant and effective in enhancing patient outcomes.
