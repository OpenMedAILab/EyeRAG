The American Academy of Ophthalmology's policy statement on biosimilars emphasizes the regulatory framework of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which allows for the approval of biosimilars with no clinically meaningful differences from reference biologics. It stresses the necessity of clinical studies for safety and efficacy in ophthalmic use and advises against off-label substitutions without robust data. While acknowledging the potential for cost reduction, the Academy insists that biosimilars should be used only when supported by clinical evidence. It opposes step therapy policies that prioritize cost over patient-specific treatments and advocates for insurance coverage of FDA-approved biologics, highlighting the need for careful consideration by ophthalmologists when prescribing biosimilars.
