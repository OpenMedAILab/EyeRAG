The "Comprehensive Adult Medical Eye Evaluation Preferred Practice Pattern" emphasizes the necessity of regular eye exams for adults, especially those without known ocular issues. Recommended intervals are every 5-10 years for under 40, every 2-4 years for ages 40-54, every 1-3 years for ages 55-64, and every 1-2 years for those 65 and older, with more frequent exams for individuals with diabetes or glaucoma risk factors. The evaluation includes a detailed history, eye examination, and diagnostic tests, with management plans customized to each patient. These guidelines, provided by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, aim to enhance eye care quality and improve patient outcomes through early detection and intervention.
