The Academy’s Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines provide a framework for evidence-based clinical practice in ophthalmology, focusing on individualized patient care. Key recommendations for cataract management include thorough assessments, criteria for surgery, and postoperative care, with surgery indicated when cataracts significantly impair vision. Preoperative responsibilities involve patient education and surgical planning, while follow-up evaluations are essential, especially for high-risk patients. Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy is advised for vision impairment due to posterior capsular opacification, with an emphasis on discussing potential complications. The guidelines prioritize ethical practice and tailored patient care.
