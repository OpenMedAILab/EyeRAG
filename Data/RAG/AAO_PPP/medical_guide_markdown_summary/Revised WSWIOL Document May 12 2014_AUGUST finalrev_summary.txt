The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Wrong-Site Task Force has issued recommendations to prevent surgical errors in ophthalmic procedures, focusing on clear communication, thorough documentation, and strict adherence to protocols. Key measures include detailed surgical orders, effective communication between staff, patient involvement in consent, marking the operative eye, and conducting a comprehensive time-out before surgery. The guidelines also stress the importance of accurate pre-operative calculations and double-checking measurements, particularly for specific surgeries like IOL, keratorefractive, and strabismus procedures, to enhance patient safety and reduce errors.
