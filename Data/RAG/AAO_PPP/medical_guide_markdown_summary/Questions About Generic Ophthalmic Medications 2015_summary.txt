In March 2011, Dr. Wiley Chambers from the FDA addressed AGS members about generic ophthalmic medications, stating that since 1992, these products must match their brand counterparts in active and inactive ingredients. Any differences necessitate clinical bioequivalence studies. While back-engineering generics is possible due to ingredient disclosure, patent protections may restrict formulation changes. The FDA ensures product quality through monitoring and stability studies, and generics must contain antimicrobial preservatives. Dr. Chambers acknowledged concerns about packaging color coding and encouraged reporting discrepancies, offering his email for further questions.
