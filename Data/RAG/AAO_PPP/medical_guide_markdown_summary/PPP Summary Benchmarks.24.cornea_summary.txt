The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines provide a framework for clinical practice based on clinical relevance, evidence strength, and general practice patterns. They emphasize that adherence to guidelines does not ensure successful outcomes, and care should be tailored to individual patients. Evidence is rated from high-quality meta-analyses to non-analytic studies, with recommendations graded accordingly. The guidelines cover initial evaluations and management for various ocular conditions, including bacterial keratitis and dry eye syndrome, detailing history-taking, examinations, diagnostic tests, management, follow-up, and patient education on risks and treatment adherence.
