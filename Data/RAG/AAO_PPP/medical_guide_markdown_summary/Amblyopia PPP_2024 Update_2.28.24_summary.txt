The American Academy of Ophthalmology has created Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines to improve eye care for amblyopia in children. These guidelines, based on scientific evidence and expert consensus, provide a flexible framework for treatment rather than strict protocols. They address amblyopia's definition, prevalence, risk factors, diagnosis, and management strategies, including optical correction, patching, and pharmacological treatments. Emphasizing personalized care, the guidelines also stress the importance of regular follow-ups and treatment adjustments. Periodically reviewed and updated without commercial influence, they aim to maintain integrity and relevance in clinical practice.
