The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines aim to improve eye care quality for conditions like corneal ectasia, including keratoconus. Based on scientific evidence and expert consensus, these guidelines provide a framework for ophthalmologists, emphasizing personalized treatment rather than strict protocols. Key recommendations include using corneal topography for diagnosis, corneal cross-linking for stabilizing keratoconus, and various contact lens options for visual rehabilitation. The guidelines advocate for early detection, individualized treatment plans, patient education, and regular follow-ups to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life while promoting innovation in ophthalmology.
