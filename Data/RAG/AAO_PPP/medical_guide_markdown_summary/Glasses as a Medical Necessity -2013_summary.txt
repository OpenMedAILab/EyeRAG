The American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, along with the American Academy of Ophthalmology, states that glasses are essential for children to prevent permanent vision loss from conditions like refractive errors, strabismus, and amblyopia. This policy was established in 2002 and reaffirmed through 2013.
