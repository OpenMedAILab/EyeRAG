The American Academy of Ophthalmology emphasizes the importance of promptly referring individuals to ophthalmologists when specific signs or symptoms of eye disease or injury are present, as early intervention can prevent vision loss. Key indicators for referral include abnormal visual acuity, significant eye injuries, flashes of light, floaters, visual field loss, and ocular abnormalities. High-risk groups, such as HIV-positive patients and certain newborns, should also be referred. This policy has been reaffirmed multiple times since its adoption in 1986.
