The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines provide a framework for quality eye care based on scientific evidence and expert consensus, allowing for individualized patient treatment. They focus on the diagnosis and management of epiretinal membranes (ERMs) and vitreomacular traction (VMT), particularly in older adults, recommending monitoring for stable cases, vitrectomy for symptomatic patients, and the use of optical coherence tomography for diagnosis. The guidelines stress the importance of physician judgment, informed consent, and patient education, while being regularly updated without commercial influence to enhance ophthalmic care and promote ethical practices.
