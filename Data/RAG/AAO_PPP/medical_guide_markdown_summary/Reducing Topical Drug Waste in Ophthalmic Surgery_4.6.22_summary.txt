A multisociety position paper, supported by major ophthalmic organizations, highlights the waste of topical ophthalmic medications during cataract surgery, which raises healthcare costs and environmental concerns. It recommends: 1) safely reusing multidose containers for multiple patients, 2) using multidose medications until their labeled expiration date, and 3) allowing patients to take home partially used medications. These measures aim to reduce waste and improve sustainability in ophthalmic surgery while ensuring patient safety.
