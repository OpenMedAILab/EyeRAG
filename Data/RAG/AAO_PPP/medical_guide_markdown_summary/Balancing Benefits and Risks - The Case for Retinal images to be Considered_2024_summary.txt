The American Academy of Ophthalmology proposes that retinal images be classified as nonprotected health information for research, citing their low risk of patient re-identification. These images are vital for early detection and treatment of retinal disorders. While HIPAA protects identifiable health information, retinal images lack personal identifiers, making them unsuitable as biometric identifiers. The Academy calls for the use of de-identified retinal images to enhance research and public health, recommending strict data use agreements to prevent unauthorized re-identification and advocating for their exclusion from biometric classifications to foster innovation in eye care.
