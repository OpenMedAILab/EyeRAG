The "Guidelines for the Cleaning and Sterilization of Intraocular Surgical Instruments," created by the OICS Task Force, provide ambulatory surgery centers with best practices for cleaning and sterilizing intraocular instruments to prevent complications like toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) and postoperative infectious endophthalmitis. Key recommendations include cleaning instruments separately from non-ophthalmic tools, using critical water for rinsing, and exercising caution with enzymatic detergents. The guidelines also cover sterilization methods, such as short-cycle steam sterilization for same-day procedures, and emphasize adherence to manufacturers' instructions. Additionally, they address environmental and cost considerations, promoting practices that minimize waste while ensuring safety and efficacy. Overall, the guidelines offer evidence-based recommendations tailored to intraocular surgery, allowing for flexibility based on individual center needs.
