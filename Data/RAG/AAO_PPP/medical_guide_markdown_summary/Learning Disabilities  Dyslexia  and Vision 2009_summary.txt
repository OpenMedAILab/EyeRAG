A joint policy statement from several medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Ophthalmology, clarifies that learning disabilities like dyslexia are language-based and not due to visual issues. It emphasizes the need for early detection and evidence-based educational interventions, while discouraging unproven treatments such as vision therapy. The statement advocates for a collaborative approach among educators, healthcare professionals, and parents to ensure proper diagnosis and tailored support, focusing on structured phonics instruction rather than visual remedies.
