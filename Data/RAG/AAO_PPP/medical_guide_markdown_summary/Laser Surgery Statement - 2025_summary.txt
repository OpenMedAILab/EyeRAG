The American Academy of Ophthalmology asserts that laser surgery should only be performed by licensed medical doctors to ensure patient safety and care quality. While laser surgery offers significant benefits in treating eye conditions like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, it also poses risks such as vision loss and tissue damage. The Academy calls for strict guidelines and specialized training for ophthalmologists to effectively manage these risks and complications associated with ocular laser procedures.
