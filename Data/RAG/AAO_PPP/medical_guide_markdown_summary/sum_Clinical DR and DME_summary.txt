The document advocates for a unified international disease severity scale for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) to enhance global communication among healthcare providers. The existing ETDRS grading system is too complex for routine use, limiting its application. The proposed simplified classification, informed by the ETDRS and WESDR studies, focuses on key lesions to aid general ophthalmologists and diabetes care providers. Developed through a 2002 expert workshop, this user-friendly scale aims to improve patient management and referral processes, though its implementation may vary by region due to differing healthcare practices.
