The American Academy of Ophthalmology states that excimer lasers for refractive surgery should only be used if FDA-approved or under an investigational device exemption (IDE). Since 1995, these lasers have been classified as "significant risk" class III devices to ensure safety and effectiveness. The Academy condemns the illegal use of unapproved lasers and stresses the importance of informing patients about approval status and off-label use, aiming to protect patient safety and ensure regulatory compliance.
