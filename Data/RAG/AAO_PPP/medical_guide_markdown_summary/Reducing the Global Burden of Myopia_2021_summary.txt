The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) formed the Task Force on Myopia in 2019 to tackle the increasing global prevalence of myopia, projected to rise from 1.4 billion in 2000 to nearly 4.8 billion by 2050. The Task Force, comprising myopia experts, aims to delay onset and slow progression in children through public health initiatives, education, and collaboration among stakeholders. Strategies include promoting outdoor activities, using optical and pharmacological treatments, and raising awareness of myopia's health implications. The AAO intends to advocate for myopia as a critical health issue and support related research and educational efforts.
