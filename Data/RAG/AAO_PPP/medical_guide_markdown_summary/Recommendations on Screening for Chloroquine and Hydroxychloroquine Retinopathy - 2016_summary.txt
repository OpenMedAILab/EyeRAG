The American Academy of Ophthalmology has updated its guidelines for screening retinopathy related to chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) based on new data. Key recommendations include: 

1. **Retinopathy Patterns**: Damage is typically parafoveal, with some Asian patients showing extramacular effects.
2. **Dosage Guidelines**: HCQ should be limited to ≤5.0 mg/kg and CQ to ≤2.3 mg/kg of real weight.
3. **Toxicity Risk**: The risk of retinopathy rises with higher doses and prolonged use, reaching 20% after 20 years of HCQ.
4. **Screening Protocol**: A baseline fundus exam is advised within the first year, with annual screenings after 5 years for patients on safe doses without major risk factors, using tests like automated visual fields and SD OCT.
5. **Counseling**: Patients must be educated on toxicity risks, proper dosing, and the necessity of regular screenings, as retinopathy is irreversible.

The guidelines stress the importance of monitoring and individualized risk assessment to mitigate retinopathy risks in patients on these medications.
