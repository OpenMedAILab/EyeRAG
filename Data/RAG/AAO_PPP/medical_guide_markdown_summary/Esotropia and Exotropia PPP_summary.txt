The American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines to improve eye care quality through scientific evidence and expert consensus. These guidelines focus on general practice patterns for ophthalmologists, emphasizing early detection and treatment of strabismus conditions like esotropia and exotropia. They outline clinical objectives, management strategies, and the importance of patient education and caregiver collaboration. The guidelines also address socioeconomic disparities in eye care access and stress the need for timely vision screenings to enhance outcomes for affected children. Regular reviews ensure the guidelines remain current, with a validity period of five years.
