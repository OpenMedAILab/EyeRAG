The Academy's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for ophthalmic practice, emphasizing individualized care. Each recommendation is rated for significance and evidence strength, but they are not strict standards and do not ensure successful outcomes. The guidelines cover comprehensive care for major conditions, particularly adult strabismus, detailing examination procedures, management plans, surgical considerations, and the importance of patient education and follow-up. Additionally, the Academy addresses ethical dilemmas in practice.
