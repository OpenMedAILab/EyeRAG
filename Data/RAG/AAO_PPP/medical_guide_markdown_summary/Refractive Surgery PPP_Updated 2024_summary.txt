The American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines to improve eye care quality through scientific evidence and expert consensus. These guidelines serve as general recommendations rather than strict protocols and are regularly updated to reflect current research. They cover various aspects of refractive surgery, including indications, techniques, and postoperative care, emphasizing thorough patient records, informed consent, and individualized care. Specific procedures like LASIK and PRK are addressed, highlighting their effectiveness and risks. The Academy encourages ethical standards in patient care and disclaims liability for outcomes related to the guidelines.
