The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines aim to improve eye care quality for conditions like bacterial keratitis. Based on scientific evidence and expert consensus, these guidelines serve as a framework for clinical practice, emphasizing physician judgment and acknowledging that adherence does not guarantee outcomes. They cover diagnosis, management, and treatment, highlighting risk factors such as contact lens use, recommending diagnostic tests, and focusing on topical antibiotics. The guidelines also address corticosteroid use for inflammation and stress the importance of patient education on infection prevention. Regularly updated and developed without commercial influence, they ensure relevance and integrity in clinical practice.
