The "Complementary Therapy Assessment" from November 2003 addresses the implications of nutritional supplements during the perioperative period for eye surgery. It aims to educate physicians and patients about potential interactions between medications and supplements, as well as the health impacts of supplement use, which is often underreported by patients. The assessment includes a preoperative screening questionnaire, reference tables, and adverse event reporting forms. It highlights the diverse and potentially harmful effects of herbal supplements, the necessity for careful monitoring, and the importance of patient disclosure prior to surgery. The document also points out the limited scientific validation and lack of FDA regulation for many supplements, urging caution in their use.
