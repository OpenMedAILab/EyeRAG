The joint policy statement from the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus stresses the necessity of timely vision screenings for infants and children, particularly between ages 3 to 5, to detect conditions like amblyopia and strabismus. Early detection is vital for effective treatment and preventing vision loss. The statement provides recommendations for community and school screening programs, primary care practices, and emphasizes the need for trained screeners and clear communication with parents regarding results and follow-up care.
