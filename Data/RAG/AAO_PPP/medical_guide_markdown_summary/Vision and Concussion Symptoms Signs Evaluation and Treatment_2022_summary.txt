The document "Vision and Concussion: Symptoms, Signs, Evaluation, and Treatment" highlights the prevalence of visual symptoms in children and adolescents post-concussion and stresses the need for clinicians to screen and manage these issues, as they can affect recovery and quality of life. While most patients recover within four weeks, some may need specialist referrals for persistent symptoms. A comprehensive visual examination is crucial, focusing on visual acuity, ocular alignment, and eye movement, with common disorders including convergence and accommodative insufficiencies. The document advocates for early identification, school accommodations, and a multidisciplinary approach to address concussion-related visual disorders in pediatric patients.
