The guidelines for managing idiopathic full thickness macular holes (iFTMH) address a common condition that can significantly impair vision, particularly in older adults. The peak incidence occurs around age 70, with a higher prevalence in women. Surgical intervention, primarily vitrectomy with gas tamponade, is the standard treatment, achieving closure rates of 80-90%. The guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for ophthalmologists, covering epidemiology, management options (including observation, vitrectomy with ILM peeling, and ocriplasmin injections), postoperative care, potential complications, and expected outcomes. They emphasize the importance of early intervention for optimal visual results and highlight the need for further research to refine treatment protocols. Overall, the guidelines aim to standardize care and improve patient outcomes in iFTMH management.
