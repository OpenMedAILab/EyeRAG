The American Academy of Ophthalmology states that only licensed ophthalmologists experienced in retinal disease should perform intravitreal injections, which have been used since 1911 to treat various eye conditions, especially with anti-VEGF agents for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. While complications are rare, they can include endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and cataracts. Patients should be informed about post-injection symptoms needing urgent care. There are potential systemic risks with anti-VEGF medications, including serious cardiovascular events, though evidence is inconclusive. The policy, first approved in 2008 and revised in 2025, highlights the need for specialized training to ensure patient safety and effective complication management.
