The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines provide a framework for quality eye care, emphasizing that they are recommendations rather than strict standards. Regularly updated, these guidelines focus on ethical practice and innovation. They outline objectives for diagnosing and managing conjunctivitis, which includes identifying causes, establishing therapies, and preventing complications. Conjunctivitis types—such as allergic, viral, and bacterial—are detailed with specific signs and treatment protocols. Key recommendations include avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use, promoting hygiene, and recognizing potential systemic diseases in chronic cases. The guidelines also address the economic impact of conjunctivitis, aiming to improve patient care while considering public health implications.
