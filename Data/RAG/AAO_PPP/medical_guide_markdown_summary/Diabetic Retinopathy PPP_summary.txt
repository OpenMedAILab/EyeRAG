The American Academy of Ophthalmology has created Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines to improve eye care for diabetic retinopathy (DR), based on scientific evidence and expert consensus. Key recommendations include regular screenings for individuals with diabetes, with annual dilated eye exams for type 1 diabetes patients starting five years post-diagnosis and for type 2 diabetes patients at diagnosis and annually thereafter. The guidelines stress the importance of controlling glucose and blood pressure, using anti-VEGF treatments for diabetic macular edema, and employing panretinal photocoagulation for proliferative DR. They also emphasize patient education about the asymptomatic nature of early DR and the need for follow-up care. The guidelines are regularly updated, evaluated using systems like GRADE and SIGN, and developed without commercial support to maintain their integrity.
