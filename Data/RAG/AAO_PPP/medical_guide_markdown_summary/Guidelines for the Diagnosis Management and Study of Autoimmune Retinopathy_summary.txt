The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Task Force has established guidelines for diagnosing and managing autoimmune retinopathy (AIR), a rare condition caused by anti-retinal antibodies. They propose a diagnostic framework categorizing patients into probable, possible, and unlikely AIR based on clinical and imaging features. Key indicators for probable AIR include rapid disease progression, specific OCT findings, FAF abnormalities, and positive anti-retinal antibodies. The guidelines stress the need for improved diagnostic accuracy, standardized antibody testing, and collaborative research to enhance understanding and treatment of AIR, as current options are limited and focus on slowing disease progression. Further research is needed to clarify AIR's pathophysiology and develop effective therapies.
