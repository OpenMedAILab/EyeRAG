The American Glaucoma Society and American Academy of Ophthalmology have issued a position statement regarding nicotinamide for glaucoma neuroprotection, highlighting its potential to protect retinal ganglion cells. However, due to concerns about drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and reported cases in clinical trials, they recommend against its use outside of clinical trials, particularly at doses of 3 grams/day or higher. Patients considering lower doses should have their liver function closely monitored, and self-medication with high-dose supplements is discouraged. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy and safety of nicotinamide.
