The 2015 report "Minimizing Medication Errors: Communication about Drug Orders" highlights the prevalence and impact of medication errors in healthcare, particularly in ophthalmology, where they contribute significantly to malpractice claims. Key factors include lack of patient and drug information, miscommunication, and inadequate education. To reduce these errors, the report stresses the need for clear communication, especially regarding similar drug names, and recommends limiting verbal orders to emergencies. It provides guidelines for prescription writing and medication administration, advocating for systematic error identification and analysis to enhance patient safety and improve care quality through collaboration among healthcare organizations.
