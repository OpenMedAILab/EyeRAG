The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommend mandatory protective eyewear for young athletes in sports with a risk of eye injury, especially for those who are functionally one-eyed or have a history of eye issues. In 2000, over 42,000 sports-related eye injuries were reported, primarily in individuals under 25. The guidelines stress the importance of properly fitted, ASTM-certified eyewear and educating athletes about eye protection options, such as polycarbonate lenses. Recommendations include using appropriate eye protection for all high-risk sports and replacing damaged eyewear, with specific guidelines tailored to different sports.
