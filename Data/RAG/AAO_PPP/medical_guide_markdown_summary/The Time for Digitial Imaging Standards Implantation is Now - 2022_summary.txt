The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) have released a joint policy statement urging the immediate adoption of digital imaging standards in ophthalmology. This initiative, stemming from discussions at the May 2022 National Eye Institute Ocular Imaging Workshop, aims to improve clinical care, data interoperability, and the integration of artificial intelligence. The statement includes ten recommendations for manufacturers, such as providing machine-readable data and using lossless compression. The AAO and ARVO stress that these standards are vital for patient safety and quality of care, calling for collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and industry to bridge implementation gaps.
