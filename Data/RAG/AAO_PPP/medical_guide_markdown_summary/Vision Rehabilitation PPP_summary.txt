The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines aim to improve eye care quality through evidence-based recommendations for ophthalmologists. While they focus on general practice rather than individual patient needs, the guidelines stress the importance of vision rehabilitation for those with vision loss, advocating a multidisciplinary approach that includes assessment, device recommendations, and psychosocial support. Key objectives include identifying patients with vision impairment, providing rehabilitation resources, and enhancing quality of life through tailored interventions. The guidelines outline a three-level model of vision rehabilitation and emphasize the need for ongoing research to better address the complex needs of patients, particularly those with neurological conditions. Overall, the PPP guidelines seek to optimize patient outcomes by addressing both functional and emotional challenges associated with vision impairment.
