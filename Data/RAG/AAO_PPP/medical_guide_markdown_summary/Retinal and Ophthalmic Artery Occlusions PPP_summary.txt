The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines provide a framework for quality eye care based on scientific evidence and expert consensus, emphasizing that they are recommendations rather than strict standards. The guidelines focus on the clinical management of retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions (RAO and OAO), highlighting the need for prompt evaluation and referral to stroke centers, especially for patients over 50 to rule out conditions like giant cell arteritis (GCA). Key recommendations include immediate referral for symptomatic occlusions, monitoring for neovascularization, and managing modifiable risk factors. The guidelines advocate for patient-centered care and collaboration with primary care providers to enhance outcomes for patients with visual impairments.
