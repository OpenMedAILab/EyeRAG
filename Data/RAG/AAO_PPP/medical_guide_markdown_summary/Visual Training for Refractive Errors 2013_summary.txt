The "Complementary Therapy Assessment" report from August 2013 evaluates visual training for myopia and finds no significant benefits in controlling refractive errors, with only subjective improvements reported. It highlights that visual training, administered by optometrists, poses a financial risk as it is often not covered by insurance. The report concludes that visual training does not impact myopia progression or improve other refractive conditions, stressing the need for rigorous scientific evaluation of complementary eye care therapies.
