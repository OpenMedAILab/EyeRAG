The Academy's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines provide a framework for ophthalmic clinical practice, emphasizing evidence-based recommendations tailored to individual patient needs. While not strict standards, the guidelines offer general guidance with recommendations rated for clinical relevance and supporting evidence. Key components include initial evaluations for conditions like Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG) and Primary Angle-Closure Disease, focusing on intraocular pressure management and individualized treatment plans. The guidelines also cover perioperative care, highlighting informed consent and postoperative monitoring. Overall, the PPP guidelines aim to improve patient care while allowing flexibility in clinical decision-making.
