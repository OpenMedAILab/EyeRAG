The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines aim to improve eye care for adult strabismus through evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus. They cover various types of strabismus, including causes, clinical objectives, and management strategies, while emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis, patient counseling, and collaboration with healthcare providers. The guidelines also address the importance of evaluating evidence quality and consider both functional and psychosocial aspects of treatment. While they provide a framework for practitioners, adherence does not guarantee success, and clinical judgment remains essential. Overall, the PPP guidelines serve as a valuable resource for ophthalmologists to enhance adult strabismus management.
