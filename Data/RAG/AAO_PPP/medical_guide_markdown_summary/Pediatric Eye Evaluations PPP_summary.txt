The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines provide a framework for quality eye care based on scientific evidence and expert consensus, emphasizing early vision screening for amblyopia and specific assessment methods for children's visual health. While not strict standards, they allow for individualized care and are regularly updated to reflect best practices. The guidelines also address socioeconomic disparities in eye care access and promote innovation, developed without commercial influence and supported by volunteer professionals.
