The American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines for retinal vein occlusions (RVO) to improve eye care quality. Based on scientific evidence and expert consensus, these guidelines provide a framework for ophthalmologists while emphasizing clinical judgment and individual patient needs. They address diagnosis, management, and treatment options such as anti-VEGF agents, corticosteroids, and laser therapy, along with systemic risk factors and patient education. Regularly updated and funded by the Academy without commercial support, the guidelines aim to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life while considering treatment costs.
