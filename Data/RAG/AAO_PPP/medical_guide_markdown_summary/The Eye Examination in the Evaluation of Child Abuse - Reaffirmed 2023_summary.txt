The policy statement "The Eye Examination in the Evaluation of Child Abuse," reaffirmed in November 2023, highlights the importance of ophthalmologic assessments in detecting child abuse, particularly abusive head trauma (AHT). It emphasizes that retinal hemorrhages are key indicators of AHT but can also arise from other medical issues. A comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist is crucial for accurate diagnosis and documentation. The statement stresses the need for timely consultations for children with unexplained neurological symptoms, careful documentation of findings, and the value of postmortem eye examinations in unexplained child deaths. Physicians are encouraged to report suspected abuse and facilitate appropriate ophthalmologic referrals to protect children's health.
