The "Patient Pain Assessment and Management" bulletin, issued by key ophthalmic organizations, emphasizes the necessity of pain assessment and management in healthcare, as mandated by JCAHO since 2001. It asserts that all patients are entitled to appropriate pain management, including initial and ongoing assessments, education, and safe medication practices. The bulletin specifies that outpatient ophthalmic patients should focus on ocular pain relevant to their conditions rather than systemic assessments. It recommends developing institutional policies for ocular pain assessments, implementing effective pain management strategies, and monitoring compliance to enhance eye care quality and patient safety.
