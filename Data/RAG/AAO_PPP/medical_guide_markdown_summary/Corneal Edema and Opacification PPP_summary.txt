The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines provide a framework for quality eye care based on scientific evidence and expert consensus. These guidelines, which are regularly updated, emphasize ethical and patient-centered care, and are not strict medical standards. They include methods for evaluating evidence strength and focus on corneal edema and opacification, covering their causes, diagnosis, and management. Key recommendations involve assessing visual function, exploring treatment options, and understanding the socioeconomic impact of corneal diseases, especially in low- to middle-income countries. The guidelines advocate for comprehensive patient education and collaboration among healthcare providers to improve treatment outcomes and enhance ophthalmic care quality.
