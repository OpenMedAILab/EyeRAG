The "Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Suspect Preferred Practice Pattern" provides guidelines for diagnosing and managing patients suspected of having primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Diagnosis involves assessing intraocular pressure (IOP), optic nerve appearance, and visual field changes, with risk factors including age, ethnicity, family history, and corneal thickness. Treatment focuses on lowering IOP to reduce POAG risk, with management goals of monitoring IOP and optic nerve health through tests like gonioscopy and imaging. The guidelines stress patient education, individualized care, and cost-effectiveness, serving as a framework for ophthalmologists to ensure quality eye care based on evidence.
