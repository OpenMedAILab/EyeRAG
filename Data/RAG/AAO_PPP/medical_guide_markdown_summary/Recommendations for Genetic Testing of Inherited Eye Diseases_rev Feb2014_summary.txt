The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Task Force on Genetic Testing highlights the advantages of genetic testing for inherited eye diseases, such as enhanced diagnosis and care, while also addressing the psychological and familial risks involved, which require skilled genetic counseling. Ophthalmologists are urged to discuss testing with patients and either perform the tests or refer them to qualified professionals. The guidelines emphasize the importance of presymptomatic and parallel testing, caution against indiscriminate massively parallel testing, and recommend using approved laboratories, providing test results to patients, avoiding direct-to-consumer tests, and being cautious with testing minors for untreatable conditions. The goal is to maximize the benefits of genetic testing while minimizing risks and costs.
