The American Academy of Ophthalmology calls for standardization of digital imaging formats in ophthalmology to improve communication, interoperability, and care quality. They advocate for adherence to DICOM standards, which would enhance data exchange between devices, improve patient care efficiency, increase physician confidence, and lower costs for manufacturers. The recommendations stress the need for machine-readable data and lossless compression, viewing standardization as crucial for advancing ophthalmic services and integrating artificial intelligence.
