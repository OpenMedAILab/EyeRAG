Cosmetic contact lenses obtained without a valid prescription pose serious risks to vision health, including infections and potential vision loss. Federal law requires a prescription for contact lenses, and unauthorized vendors may sell unsafe products. Users are at higher risk for complications due to lack of education on lens care. Proper hygiene, regular eye exams, and adherence to prescribed usage are crucial for safe wear. The American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Academy of Optometry stress the need for professional supervision for all contact lenses.
