The "Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Preferred Practice Pattern" provides guidelines for managing primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a chronic eye disease leading to optic nerve damage and vision loss. Key risk factors include age, ethnicity, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), family history, and certain health conditions. Treatment options to lower IOP include medications, laser therapy, and surgery. Early diagnosis through comprehensive evaluations is emphasized, along with regular follow-ups to monitor disease progression. The guidelines also address the socioeconomic impact of glaucoma, particularly in minority populations, and highlight the importance of patient education and adherence to treatment for better outcomes. Overall, they serve as a framework for ophthalmologists to effectively manage POAG while considering individual patient needs.
