The "Consensus Recommendations for Ocular Surveillance of von Hippel-Lindau Disease" provides guidelines for monitoring individuals with VHL disease, which is marked by tumors like retinal hemangioblastomas (RHs). It stresses early detection through periodic ocular screenings starting in the first year of life, with genetic testing for at-risk individuals. Recommended screening intervals are every 6-12 months until age 30, then annually. The guidelines advocate for dilated ophthalmoscopy and suggest ultra-widefield imaging as useful tools. Prompt treatment of small RHs is advised to preserve vision. Developed by the International VHL Surveillance Guidelines Consortium, these guidelines aim to standardize care and enhance patient outcomes.
