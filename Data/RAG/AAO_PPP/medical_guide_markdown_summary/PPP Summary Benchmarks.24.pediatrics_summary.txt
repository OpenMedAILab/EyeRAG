The Academy's Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines provide a framework for evidence-based clinical practice in ophthalmology, focusing on general care patterns rather than individual patient management. Each guideline is rated for importance and evidence strength, emphasizing thorough evaluations for conditions like amblyopia and strabismus. Care strategies are tailored to factors such as age and visual acuity, with ongoing follow-up and patient education to enhance treatment collaboration. While the guidelines serve as a resource for practitioners, they do not guarantee outcomes and acknowledge the necessity of individualized care.
