The March 2007 "Complementary Therapy Assessment" evaluates acupuncture for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and finds insufficient scientific evidence to support its safety or effectiveness. A search of the MEDLINE database revealed no relevant studies, and two small case series lacked rigorous design. Risks include potential adverse effects, especially near the eye. The assessment calls for larger, well-designed studies and concludes that current evidence does not support acupuncture as a viable treatment for AMD compared to established therapies.
