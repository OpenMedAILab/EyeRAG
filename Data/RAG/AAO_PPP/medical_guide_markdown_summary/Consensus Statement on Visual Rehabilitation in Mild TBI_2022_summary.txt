The consensus statement on visual rehabilitation in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) addresses the difficulties in diagnosing and treating visual disorders linked to mTBI, such as posttrauma visual syndrome and convergence insufficiency. It notes the widespread occurrence of mTBI but highlights the weak scientific foundation for many visual diagnoses and treatments, which often rely on anecdotal evidence. The statement calls for improved diagnostic criteria and evidence-based treatment methods, as current therapies lack substantial proof of effectiveness. It advocates for prospective studies to enhance care for mTBI patients with ongoing visual symptoms and urges a cautious approach to visual rehabilitation until more robust evidence is established.
