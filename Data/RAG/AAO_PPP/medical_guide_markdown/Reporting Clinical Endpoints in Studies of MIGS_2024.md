Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) refers to a group of procedures generally characterized by an ab interno approach, minimal trauma to ocular tissue, moderate efficacy, an excellent safety profile, and rapid recovery. The number of MIGS procedures continues to increase, and their use has become widespread among glaucoma and cataract specialists. Standardization of the methodology and reporting of clinical endpoints in MIGS investigations enhances interpretation and comparison across different studies. The assessment of surgical interventions not only should consider statistical significance, but also whether the outcome is meaningful to patients. Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is defined as the smallest change in a treatment outcome that is considered beneficial for an individual patient and prompts a change in their clinical management. Expert consensus is an accepted approach to determine the MCID. The American Academy of Ophthalmology’s Glaucoma Preferred Practice Pattern Committee is an expert panel that develops guidelines identifying characteristics and components of quality eye care. The Committee recommends that the cumulative probability of surgical success at 2 years with Kaplan–Meier survival analysis be used as the primary efficacy endpoint in MIGS studies. The Committee suggests that surgical success for standalone MIGS be defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) of 21 mmHg or less and reduced by 20% or more from baseline without an increase in glaucoma medications, additional laser or incisional glaucoma surgery, loss of light perception vision, or hypotony. The proposed MCID for the cumulative probability of success of standalone MIGS at 2 years is 50%. The panel recommends that surgical success for MIGS combined with cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation (CE-IOL) be defined as a decrease in glaucoma medical therapy of 1 medication or more from baseline without an increase in IOP or IOP of 21 mmHg or less and reduced by 20% or more from baseline without an increase in glaucoma medications, additional laser or incisional glaucoma surgery, loss of light perception vision, or hypotony. The suggested MCID for the cumulative probability of success for MIGS combined with CE-IOL at 2 years is 65%.

## The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Glaucoma Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP)
The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Glaucoma Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) Committee develops guidelines that identify characteristics and components of quality eye care for patients with glaucoma. These guidelines are based on the best available scientific data as interpreted by the Committee. In some instances, such as when results of carefully conducted clinical trials are available and the data are particularly persuasive, clear guidance can be provided. In other cases, the Committee must rely on evaluation of available information and their collective judgment to make recommendations.
Innovation in medicine is essential to ensure the future health of the public. The American Academy of Ophthalmology encourages the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic methods that will improve eye care. It is essential to recognize that true medical excellence is achieved only when patients’ needs and outcomes are the foremost considerations.
## Background
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.¹ The current treatment of glaucoma is directed toward lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent or slow progressive damage to the optic nerve. Reduction of IOP is achieved through the use of medical therapy, laser surgery, and glaucoma surgery. Glaucoma medications typically are used in the initial management of glaucoma, but ocular toxicity and patient adherence are major concerns for some patients.²,³ Laser trabeculoplasty has been shown to be a safe and effective first-line therapy for open-angle glaucoma,⁴,⁵ or it may be used as a supplement to medications. Glaucoma surgery historically has been reserved for patients in whom medications and appropriate laser surgery treatment fail to provide adequate IOP control.
## Traditional Glaucoma Surgery and Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery
Traditional glaucoma surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy and tube shunts) promotes the drainage of aqueous humor into the subconjunctival space. These procedures may have a lengthy period of recovery and carry a risk of serious complications, such as bleb-related endophthalmitis and suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) is a newer group of non–bleb-forming procedures that are performed using an ab interno approach. Intraocular pressure reduction is achieved with minimal disruption to ocular tissue, allowing a more rapid restoration of vision after surgery. Some MIGS procedures enhance aqueous drainage through the trabecular outflow pathway, and others improve uveoscleral outflow. Subconjunctival devices, such as the Xen Gel Stent (AbbVie, Inc.), should be considered separately from MIGS because they form a bleb, commonly are implanted from an ab externo approach, and have a different safety and efficacy profile. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery offers a lower risk of surgical complications than traditional glaucoma surgery, but is less effective in reducing IOP.
A trade-off exists between safety and efficacy with all currently available glaucoma operations. The benefit of any glaucoma procedure in lowering IOP must be weighed in the context of its potential complications. The risk of traditional glaucoma surgery is justified in patients with advanced or rapidly progressive disease requiring a low target IOP, or both, or for those in whom less invasive options have failed. The favorable safety profile of MIGS has prompted earlier surgical intervention for many patients with mild to moderate glaucoma. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery frequently is performed in combination with cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation (CE-IOL) for the purpose of reducing IOP or the burden of medical therapy. No single glaucoma surgery is appropriate for every patient. Selection of a glaucoma procedure must be tailored to the individual patient and should consider the surgeon’s experience and proficiency, the degree of IOP reduction needed based on severity and stability of disease, risk factors for complications, and the patient’s willingness to accept surgical risks and the potential need for additional surgery.
## Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery Procedures
The number of MIGS procedures continues to grow, and their use has become widespread among glaucoma and cataract specialists. Only procedures that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are discussed herein. Table 1 provides efficacy results from large prospective studies of MIGS that enrolled at least 100 patients.
### Trabecular Meshwork and Schlemm’s Canal Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery
Many MIGS procedures decrease IOP by improving aqueous drainage through the trabecular outflow system. The juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork has been identified as the site of greatest resistance to aqueous outflow. This resistance can be overcome by bypassing the trabecular meshwork with placement of a stent or by cutting or removing tissue. Intraocular pressure elevation causes the collapse of Schlemm’s canal, leading to chronic changes in the canal and trabecular meshwork. Dilation of Schlemm’s canal through cannulation is another approach to improve drainage through the normal physiologic aqueous outflow system.
### Stenting Procedures: iStent and iStent Inject
The first-generation iStent (Glaukos Corp.) is a snorkel-shaped device made of heparin-coated titanium that is implanted in Schlemm’s canal using a preloaded injector. The iStent was approved by the FDA for implantation in conjunction with cataract surgery in patients with mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma. The US iStent Study was a multicenter randomized clinical trial that treated 117 patients with CE-IOL and iStent implantation and 123 patients with CE-IOL alone. The proportion of patients with unmedicated IOP of 21 mmHg or less was significantly higher after CE-IOL and iStent implantation than CE-IOL alone at 2 years (61% in the CE-IOL and iStent group vs. 50% in CE-IOL group; P = 0.036).
The second-generation iStent Inject (Glaukos Corp.) is a bullet-shaped device with a head that is placed in Schlemm’s canal, a thorax that rests in the trabecular meshwork, and a rear flange that resides in the anterior chamber. The injector is preloaded with 2 stents, and they are injected 2 to 3 clock hours apart. The iStent Inject has the same material composition and indications as its predecessor. The iStent Inject Study was a multicenter randomized clinical trial that compared CE-IOL and iStent Inject implantation in 387 patients and CE-IOL alone in 118 patients. The proportion of patients who achieved an IOP reduction of 20% or more from baseline after washout was significantly higher after CE-IOL and iStent Inject implantation than CE-IOL alone at 2 years (75.8% in the CE-IOL and iStent Inject group vs. 61.9% in the CE-IOL group; P = 0.005).
The iStent Infinite (Glaukos Corp.) consists of 3 stents in a single preloaded injector. iStent Infinite was approved by the FDA as a standalone procedure for patients with primary open-angle glaucoma in whom previous medical and surgical treatment has failed. The iStent Infinite Study was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trial evaluating outcomes of the iStent Infinite in 72 patients. The overall rate of surgical success (IOP reduced ≥ 20% from baseline without safety events) was 76.1% at 1 year.
Similar surgical complications occur with the iStent and iStent Inject. Adverse events reported in randomized clinical trials included hyphema (1.2%–1.9%), IOP spikes (1%–33.3%), corneal injury (3.1%), peripheral anterior synechiae formation (1.8%), and cyclodialysis cleft (1.2%). Stent-related complications included obstruction (1%–13.2%) and malposition (3%–18%).
### Hydrus Microstent
The Hydrus Microstent (Alcon) is an 8-mm nitinol scaffold that is inserted into Schlemm’s canal using a preloaded injector. The microstent spans approximately 90° and dilates Schlemm’s canal to 4 to 5 times its natural width. The device is FDA approved for

implantation in patients with mild to moderate primary open-angle glaucoma. The HORIZON Study was a multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing CE-IOL and Hydrus implantation in 369 patients and CE-IOL alone in 187 patients. The washout-mean IOP reduction was significantly greater with CE-IOL and Hydrus implantation than CE-IOL alone at 2 years (−7.6 mmHg in the CE-IOL plus Hydrus group vs. −5.3 mmHg in the CE-IOL group; P < 0.001), and the proportion of patients with IOP reduction of 20% or more after washout was significantly higher after CE-IOL plus Hydrus implantation compared with CE-IOL alone (77.3% in the CE-IOL plus Hydrus group vs. 57.8% in the CE-IOL group; P < 0.001). The COMPARE Study was a multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing 2 standalone MIGS procedures, including the Hydrus Microstent in 75 patients and 2 first-generation iStents in 77 patients. The cumulative probability of surgical success (IOP ≤ 18 mmHg without glaucoma medications or additional surgery) was significantly greater after implantation of the Hydrus Microstent relative to 2 iStents (35.6% in the Hydrus group vs. 10.5% in the iStent group; P = 0.001). Most complications of the Hydrus Microstent were self-limited, including hyphema (0.5%–36.0%), IOP spikes (0.5%–20%), and corneal edema (1.4%–28.0%). Adverse events relating to the microstent itself included focal peripheral anterior synechiae (6.7%–20.0%), device obstruction (1.1%–12.2%), and device malposition (1.1%).
### Dilation Procedures
#### Ab Interno Canaloplasty
Ab interno canaloplasty (ABiC) enhances aqueous outflow through circumferential dilation of Schlemm's canal and collector channels using the iTrack (Nova Eye Medical) illuminated microcatheter. Unlike ab externo canaloplasty, ABiC does not involve incision of the conjunctiva or placement of a tension suture. A randomized single-center trial compared ABiC in 38 eyes with gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) in 39 eyes. Mean IOP was significantly lower after GATT compared with ABiC (16.0 mmHg in the GATT group vs. 19.0 mmHg in the ABiC group; P = 0.003), but no statistically significant difference was found in the cumulative probability of complete success (IOP ≤ 21 mmHg without glaucoma medications or additional surgery) between the two procedures at 1 year (75% in the GATT group vs. 56% in the ABiC group; P = 0.09). Hyphema (47%), IOP spikes (42%), and supraciliary effusion (71%) were common complications after ABiC.
#### OMNI Surgical System
The OMNI Surgical System (Sight Sciences, Inc.) uses a flexible microcatheter to perform viscodilation of Schlemm’s canal and collector channels (previously VISCO360). Complete circumferential treatment is performed with two 180° passes. No prospective studies evaluating OMNI viscodilation are presently available.
#### Streamline Surgical System
The Streamline Surgical System (New World Medical, Inc.) involves cannulation and viscodilation of Schlemm’s canal and collector channels. Currently no large prospective or retrospective studies investigating the Streamline Surgical System are available.
### Tissue Cutting and Removing Procedures
#### Trabecotome
The Trabecotome (MicroSurgical Technology) is a handheld electrocautery device with its own irrigation and aspiration system that ablates up to 180° of the trabecular meshwork and inner wall of Schlemm’s canal. The footplate minimizes thermal damage to surrounding tissues and acts as a guide for the electrosurgical tip during ablation. In a meta-analysis of 5091 patients, the rate of surgical success (IOP ≤ 21 mmHg and reduced ≥ 20% from baseline while avoiding reoperation) was 46% for standalone Trabectome and 85% for CE-IOL plus Trabectome treatment at 2 years. The most common complications included hyphema (up to 100%), peripheral anterior synechiae (14%), and IOP spikes (6%). Spontaneous, delayed hyphema (4.6%) has been reported up to 31 months after uncomplicated Trabectome treatment.
#### Kahook Dual Blade
The Kahook Dual Blade (KDB; New World Medical, Inc.) is a single-use instrument with 2 parallel blades on a footplate and ramp. The KDB’s unique design allows excision of a strip of trabecular meshwork and inner wall of Schlemm’s canal with minimal collateral damage to adjacent structures. A multicenter randomized clinical trial compared CE-IOL plus KDB treatment in 82 eyes and CE-IOL plus iStent implantation in 82 eyes. Similar mean IOP (15.4 mmHg in the CE-IOL plus KDB group vs. 16.1 mmHg in the CE-IOL plus iStent group; P = 0.24) and number of glaucoma medications (0.27 in the CE-IOL plus KDB group vs. 0.41 in the CE-IOL plus iStent group; P = 0.17) were observed with both procedures after 1 year of follow-up. The proportion of eyes achieving surgical success (IOP reduced ≥ 20% from baseline or glaucoma medication therapy decreased ≥ 1 medication from baseline) was significantly higher after CE-IOL plus KDB treatment compared with CE-IOL plus iStent implantation at 1 year (93.7% in the CE-IOL plus KDB group vs. 83.3% in the CE-IOL plus iStent group; P = 0.04). Transient hyphema (up to 17%) and IOP spikes (up to 17%) were the most common early postoperative complications. Infrequent complications included injury to Descemet's membrane (3.8%) and creation of a cyclodialysis cleft (up to 1.2%).
#### Tanito Microhook
The Tanito Microhook (TMH; Inami & Co., Ltd.) is a reusable instrument with a sharpened bent tip that is available in straight, right-angled, and left-angled forms. Ab interno TMH trabeculotomy is a procedure that cleaves the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal. A randomized single-center trial compared CE-IOL plus TMH treatment in 57 patients and CE-IOL alone in 57 patients. The degree of IOP reduction was significantly greater after CE-IOL plus TMH treatment than CE-IOL alone after 1 year of follow-up (51.5% in the CE-IOL plus TMH group vs. 20.1% in the CE-IOL group; P < 0.001), and the cumulative probability of complete surgical success (IOP ≤ 18 mmHg or reduced ≥ 20% from baseline without glaucoma medications) was significantly higher with CE-IOL plus TMH treatment relative to CE-IOL alone at 1 year (90.3% in the CE-IOL plus TMH group vs. 0% in the CE-IOL group; P < 0.001). The most frequent complication of TMH was hyphema (7%).
## Gonioscopy-Assisted Transluminal Trabeculotomy
Gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy involves circumferential cannulation and subsequent cleaving of Schlemm’s canal using a suture or iTrack illuminated microcatheter. A meta-analysis of 537 eyes showed that GATT produced a 9.8-mmHg reduction in IOP, and glaucoma medications were decreased by 1.7 medications. The most frequent complications were hyphema (12.5%–80.6%), IOP spikes (1.9%–32.3%), and transient hypotony (4.5%–6.5%). Descemet’s detachment (0.5%), iridodialysis (0.5%), and vitreous hemorrhage (2.9%) occurred less commonly. Choroidal detachment has been detected using anterior segment OCT in 47.7% of patients undergoing GATT, although typically they were asymptomatic and self-limited.
### OMNI Surgical System
The OMNI Surgical System may be used to perform viscodilation of Schlemm’s canal and collector channels and a trabeculotomy (previously TRAB360). The flexible microcatheter is passed 180° in opposite directions to allow treatment of 360° of the angle. In the GEMINI Study, canaloplasty and trabeculotomy using the OMNI Surgical System resulted in IOP reduction of 20% or more from baseline after washout in 84.2% of patients at 1 year. Mean IOP was lowered 35%, and the mean number of glaucoma medications decreased 80%. Hyphema (6%) and IOP spikes (2%) were the most common complications.
## Supracoroidal Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery
Supracoroidal MIGS creates a cyclodialysis and increases uveoscleral outflow through a device that connects the anterior chamber and supracoroidal space. The CyPass Micro-Stent (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) is a supracoroidal MIGS that was withdrawn from the market voluntarily in 2018 after a postapproval study demonstrated significantly greater endothelial cell loss at 5 years in patients who underwent CE-IOL plus CyPass implantation compared with CE-IOL alone. Since the removal of CyPass, no FDA-approved supracoroidal MIGS devices have been made available.
## Guidelines in Reporting Glaucoma Surgical Outcomes
Untreated glaucoma is a slowly progressive disease in most patients. Assessing the effectiveness of interventions in preventing glaucomatous progression is difficult because long-term follow-up and large sample sizes are needed. A strong relationship exists between IOP reduction and stabilization of glaucoma. Therefore, IOP is considered a valid clinical endpoint to evaluate the efficacy of glaucoma surgery.
The World Glaucoma Association (WGA) has published guidelines on the design and reporting of glaucoma surgical trials. These guidelines were developed before the widespread adoption of MIGS, and they were directed toward traditional glaucoma surgery. More recently, the European Glaucoma Society (EGS) has provided recommendations for the design and presentation of data from glaucoma surgical trials with a focus on MIGS and future innovations.
The development of standardized methodologies and reporting of clinical endpoints for glaucoma surgical trials enhances the interpretation of results and facilitates comparisons across different studies. The WGA and EGS guidelines recommend defining surgical success and failure using a combination of percentage IOP reduction from baseline and an upper IOP limit. Alternative success-and-failure criteria with various levels of percentage reduction and upper IOP limits also may be presented. Intraocular pressure failure criteria should be present on 2 consecutive visits to account for adjustments in treatment. Eyes that need a second glaucoma procedure, lose light perception vision, or experience sustained hypotony should also be considered treatment failures. Complete success is achieved if glaucoma medications are not required, and qualified success involves the use of glaucoma medications for IOP control. A predefined protocol for adding glaucoma medications minimizes treatment bias. Reporting baseline IOP as the mean of 3 diurnal readings is preferred. A medication washout at baseline and at predetermined postoperative visits allows better determination of procedural efficacy by removing the confounding effect of medical therapy. However, a washout may not be feasible in patients with more advanced disease because of safety concerns and generally is not available in retrospective studies. Visual acuity, IOP, and number of glaucoma medications should be reported at baseline and at specified time points after surgery, such as 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 2 years. Consistent and comprehensive reporting of surgical complications should be undertaken.
Comparative MIGS trials were found to have low adherence to WGA guidelines. In most MIGS studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving IOP reduction of 20% or more from baseline without glaucoma medications. Secondary endpoints included the mean change in IOP, mean change in the number of glaucoma medications, proportion of patients requiring additional glaucoma procedures, and surgical complications.
Multicenter randomized clinical trials used in the FDA approval process for MIGS devices have involved a comparison of MIGS with CE-IOL versus CE-IOL alone. A limited number of prospective clinical trials have compared different MIGS as standalone procedures or in combination with cataract surgery. Enrolled patients generally had mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma with elevated IOP, and caution should be exercised in extrapolating results to dissimilar patient groups. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery trials consistently have shown that approximately two-thirds of the reduction in IOP and medical therapy was related to the CE-IOL portion of combined procedures and one-third was related to the MIGS device. Cataract surgery alone frequently was effective in lowering IOP and glaucoma medical therapy, but concurrently performing MIGS produced a statistically significant greater reduction in IOP.
## Minimal Clinically Important Difference
The clinical interpretation of interventions must consider not only statistical significance, but also whether the observed outcome is meaningful to patients. Statistical significance is linked to the size of the population being studied. Given a large enough sample, statistical significance between treatment groups may occur with very small differences in outcomes that are not clinically meaningful. The concept of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was introduced by Jaeschke et al. Minimal clinically important difference is defined as the smallest change in a treatment outcome that is considered beneficial for an individual patient and prompts a change in their clinical management. The minimal clinically important difference generally involves patient-reported outcome measures, but variations lie outside patient reports. Minimal clinically important differences have been developed for changes in clinical parameters or effectiveness of clinical interventions. Expert consensus is an accepted approach to determine the MCID.
The ideal measure of success of any glaucoma therapy is the prevention of further glaucomatous optic nerve damage and preservation of visual function and quality of life. Treatment success for individual patients cannot be defined by an arbitrary IOP level because individuals vary in the susceptibility of their optic nerves to the damaging effect of IOP. Nevertheless, IOP reduction is the goal of all current glaucoma therapy, and no other surrogate measure better reflects therapeutic success. The Glaucoma PPP Committee recommends that the cumulative probability of surgical success at 2 years with Kaplan–Meier analysis be used as the primary efficacy endpoint in MIGS trials. Patients who have not failed and are using supplemental medical therapy should be classified as achieving qualified success, and those not using glaucoma medications should be categorized as complete successes.
The definition of surgical success should include an upper IOP level and percentage reduction from the preoperative level, as outlined by the WGA and EGS in their guidelines for reporting outcomes of glaucoma surgical trials. The Glaucoma PPP Committee recommends defining surgical success for standalone MIGS procedures as achieving an IOP of 21 mmHg or less and reduced 20% or more from baseline without an increase in the number of glaucoma medications, additional laser or incisional glaucoma surgery, loss of light perception vision, or hypotony. The criteria for inadequate IOP control (i.e., > 21 mmHg or reduced < 20%) and hypotony (i.e., IOP ≤ 5 mmHg) should be present on 2 consecutive postoperative visits to be considered treatment failures. Similar definitions of success and failure have been used in numerous surgical trials involving MIGS and traditional glaucoma surgery.
The success rates for trabeculectomy with mitomycin C and tube shunt surgery have ranged from 82.7% to 96.1% at 1 year and from 67% to 84.9% at 3 years. The proposed MCID for the cumulative probability of surgical success for standalone MIGS at 2 years is 50%. A lower success rate for MIGS compared with traditional glaucoma surgery is appropriate, given the more favorable safety profile of MIGS. Additionally, the effectiveness of subsequent glaucoma surgery should not be impacted by MIGS because a conjunctival incision is not made. The Committee acknowledges that different patient populations are treated with traditional glaucoma surgery and MIGS, and this likely has influenced the reported rates of surgical success in prior studies.
The Glaucoma PPP Committee suggests that surgical success of MIGS combined with CE-IOL be defined as a decrease in glaucoma medical therapy of 1 medication or more from baseline without an increase in IOP, or IOP of 21 mmHg or less and reduced 20% or more from baseline without an increase in glaucoma medications, additional laser or incisional glaucoma surgery, loss of light perception vision, or hypotony. This definition reflects the dual goals of combined CE-IOL plus MIGS procedures, including IOP lowering in some cases and reduction of the burden of glaucoma medical therapy in other cases. The criteria for inadequate IOP control (i.e., > 21 mmHg or reduced < 20%) and hypotony (i.e., IOP ≤ 5 mmHg) should be present on 2 consecutive postoperative visits to be considered treatment failures. At 2 years, CE-IOL alone produced an IOP reduction of 20% or more after washout in 46% to 61.9% of patients, and the mean number of glaucoma medications decreased by 0.8 to 1.0 medications. The recommended MCID for the cumulative probability of surgical success for MIGS combined with CE-IOL at 2 years is 65%. Combined CE-IOL plus MIGS should provide meaningful additional reduction of IOP and glaucoma medical therapy beyond what is offered by CE-IOL alone.
## Conclusions
Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery has transformed the landscape of glaucoma management by providing alternatives to traditional glaucoma surgery, allowing more options that balance the benefits and risks of glaucoma surgery. These procedures reduce IOP by targeting various anatomic pathways. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery offers a more favorable safety profile compared with traditional glaucoma surgery, but MIGS is less effective in lowering IOP. No single glaucoma surgery is appropriate for every patient, and selection of a glaucoma procedure must be tailored to the individual patient. The IOP-lowering effect of all available glaucoma procedures tends to decline over time. Glaucoma is a lifelong disease, and repeat glaucoma surgery frequently is required. Because MIGS does not involve a conjunctival incision, it does not jeopardize the success of future glaucoma surgery. Establishing meaningful clinical endpoints for MIGS studies will inform future advancements.
