## SUMMARY BENCHMARKS FOR PREFERRED PRACTICE PATTERN GUIDELINES
### Introduction
These are summary benchmarks for the Academy’s Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines. The Preferred Practice Pattern series of guidelines has been written on the basis of three principles.
- Each Preferred Practice Pattern should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful information to practitioners.
- Each recommendation that is made should be given an explicit rating that shows its importance to the care process.
- Each recommendation should also be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence that supports the recommendation and reflects the best evidence available.
### Preferred Practice Patterns provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular individual.
While they should generally meet the needs of most patients, they cannot possibly best meet the needs of all patients. Adherence to these Preferred Practice Patterns will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation. These practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results. It may be necessary to approach different patients’ needs in different ways. The physician must make the ultimate judgment about the propriety of the care of a particular patient in light of all of the circumstances presented by that patient. The American Academy of Ophthalmology is available to assist members in resolving ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of ophthalmic practice.
The Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual situations. The Academy specifically disclaims any and all liability for injury or other damages of any kind, from negligence or otherwise, for any and all claims that may arise out of the use of any recommendations or other information contained herein.
For each major disease condition, recommendations for the process of care, including the history, physical exam and ancillary tests, are summarized, along with major recommendations for the care management, follow-up, and education of the patient. For each PPP, a detailed literature search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library for articles in the English language is conducted. The results are reviewed by an expert panel and used to prepare the recommendations, which are then given a rating that shows the strength of evidence when sufficient evidence exists.
### To rate individual studies, a scale based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) is used.
The definitions and levels of evidence to rate individual studies are as follows:
- **I++**: High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias
- **I+**: Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias
- **I-**: Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias
- **II++**: High-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies; high-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal
- **II+**: Well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal
- **II-**: Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal
- **III**: Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series)
## Summary Benchmarks for Preferred Practice Pattern Guidelines
### Introduction (continued)
Recommendations for care are formed based on the body of the evidence. The body of evidence quality ratings are defined by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) as follows:
- **Good quality (GQ):** Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
- **Moderate quality (MQ):** Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
- **Insufficient quality (IQ):** Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; any estimate of effect is very uncertain.
Key recommendations for care are defined by GRADE as follows:
- **Strong recommendation (SR):** Used when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects or clearly do not.
- **Discretionary recommendation (DR):** Used when the trade-offs are less certain—either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced.
The PPPs are intended to serve as guides in patient care, with greatest emphasis on technical aspects. In applying this knowledge, it is essential to recognize that true medical excellence is achieved only when skills are applied in such a manner that the patients’ needs are the foremost consideration. The Academy is available to assist members in resolving ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of practice. *(Academy Code of Ethics)*
## Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (Initial Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Ocular history (e.g., refractive error, trauma, prior ocular surgery)
- Race/ethnicity
- Family history
- Systemic history
- Review of pertinent records
- Current medications
- Prior glaucoma laser or incisional surgery
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity measurement
- Pupil examination
- Confrontational visual fields
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- IOP measurement
- Gonioscopy
- Optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) examination
- Fundus examination
### Diagnostic Testing (Key elements)
- Central corneal thickness (CCT) measurement
- Visual field evaluation
- ONH, RNFL, and macular imaging
### Management Plan for Whom Therapy is Indicated
- The goal of treatment is to control the IOP in a target range and ensure the ONH/RNFL and visual fields are stable
- Target IOP is an estimate and must be individualized and/or adjusted during the course of the disease
- Set an initial target pressure of at least 25% lower than pretreatment IOP. Choosing a lower target IOP can be justified if there is severe optic nerve damage, if the damage is progressing rapidly, or if other risk factors are present (e.g., family history, age, or disc hemorrhages)
- The IOP can be lowered by medical treatment, laser therapy, or incisional surgery (alone or in combination)
- Medical therapy is presently the most common initial intervention to lower IOP (see Table 4 of the POAG PPP for an overview of options available); consider balance between side effects and effectiveness in choosing a regimen of maximal effectiveness and tolerance to achieve the desired IOP reduction for each patient
- If progression occurs at the target pressure, undetected IOP fluctuations and adherence to the therapeutic regimen and recommendations for therapeutic alternatives should be discussed before adjusting target IOP downward
- Assess the patient who is being treated with glaucoma medication for local ocular and systemic side effects and toxicity
- Laser trabeculoplasty may be used as initial or adjunctive therapy in patients with POAG (see Table 5 of the POAG PPP). Laser trabeculectomy is effective in lowering IOP and may be performed to 180 degrees or to 360 degrees of the angle
### Perioperative Care for Laser Trabeculoplasty Patients
- The ophthalmologist who performs surgery has the following responsibilities:
  - Obtain informed consent from the patient or patient’s surrogate decision maker after discussing the risk, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery
  - Ensure that the preoperative evaluation confirms that surgery is indicated
  - At least one IOP check immediately prior to surgery and within 30 minutes to 2 hours after surgery
  - Follow-up examination within 6 weeks of surgery or sooner if there is concern about IOP-related damage to the optic nerve
### Perioperative Care in Incisional Glaucoma Surgery Patients
- The ophthalmologist who performs surgery has the following responsibilities:
  - Perform gonioscopy preoperatively, especially when considering trabecular meshwork/Schlemm’s canal-based MIGS (see Table 6 of the POAG PPP)
  - Obtain informed consent from the patient or patient’s surrogate decision maker after discussing the risk, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery
  - Ensure that the preoperative evaluation accurately documents findings and indications for surgery
  - Prescribe topical corticosteroids in the postoperative period
## Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (Initial Evaluation) (continued)
- Follow-up evaluation on the first postoperative day and at least once during the first 1 to 2 weeks to evaluate visual acuity, IOP, and status of the anterior segment.
- In the absence of complications, perform additional postoperative visits during a 3-month period to evaluate visual acuity, IOP, and status of the anterior segment.
- Schedule more frequent follow-up visits, as necessary, for patients with postoperative complications (flat or shallow anterior chamber, early bleb failure, increased inflammation, or Tenon's cyst).
- Undertake additional treatments as necessary to improve aqueous flow into the bleb and lower IOP if evidence of bleb failure develops, including injection of antifibrotic agents, bleb massage, suture adjustment, release or lysis, or bleb needling.
- Manage postoperative complications as they develop, such as repair of bleb leak or reformation of a flat anterior chamber.
- Explain that filtration surgery places the eye at risk for endophthalmitis for the duration of the patient's life, and that if the patient has symptoms of pain and decreased vision and the signs of redness and discharge he or she should notify the ophthalmologist immediately.
### Patient Education for Patients with Medical Therapy
- Discuss diagnosis, severity of the disease, prognosis and management plan, and likelihood of lifelong therapy.
- Educate about eyelid closure or nasolacrimal occlusion when applying topical medications to reduce systemic absorption.
- Encourage patients to alert their ophthalmologist to physical or emotional changes that occur when taking glaucoma medications.
## Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (Follow-up Evaluation)
### Follow-up Exam History
- Interval ocular history
- Interval systemic medical history
- Side effects of ocular medications
- Review of pertinent medication use, including time of last administration
### Follow-up Physical Exam
- Visual acuity measurement
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- IOP measurement
- Perform gonioscopy if there is a suspicion of angle-closure component, anterior chamber shallowing or anterior chamber angle abnormalities, or if there is an unexplained change in IOP. Perform gonioscopy periodically.
- ONH and visual field evaluation
### Adjustment of Therapy
- Target IOP is not achieved and benefits of a change in therapy outweigh the risks
- Progressive optic nerve damage despite achieving the target IOP
- Patient’s intolerant of the prescribed medical regimen
- Contraindications to individual medications develop
- Stable optic nerve status and low IOP occur for a prolonged period in a patient taking topical ocular hypotensive agents. Under these circumstances, a carefully monitored attempt to reduce the medical regimen may be appropriate.
- Downward adjustment of target pressure can be made in the face of progressive optic disc, imaging, or visual field change
- Upward adjustment of target pressure can be considered if the patient has been stable and if the patient either requires or desires less medication
### Patient Education
- Educate about the disease process, the rationale and goals of intervention, the status of their condition, and relative benefits and risks of alternative interventions so that patients can participate meaningfully in developing an appropriate plan of action
- Patients considering keratorefractive surgery should be informed about the possible impact laser vision correction has on reducing contrast sensitivity and decreasing the accuracy of IOP measurements
- Patients with substantial visual impairment or blindness can be referred for and encouraged to use appropriate vision rehabilitation and social services
### Follow-Up
#### TABLE: Consensus-based Guidelines for Follow-up Glaucoma Status
| Target IOP Achieved | Progression of Damage | Duration of Control (months) | Approximate Follow-up Interval (months)* |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Yes                  | No                    | ≤6                          | 6                                       |

| No                   | Yes                   | NA                          | 1–2                                     |
| No                   | No                    | NA                          | 3–6                                     |
*IOP = intraocular pressure; NA = not applicable
*Patients with more advanced damage or greater lifetime risk from primary open-angle glaucoma may require more frequent evaluations. These intervals are the maximum recommended time between evaluations.
## Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Suspect (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Ocular history (e.g., refractive error, trauma, prior ocular surgery)
- Race/ethnicity
- Family history
- Systemic history
- Review of pertinent records
- Current and prior ocular and nonocular medications
- Prior cataract surgery, LASIK and/or incisional surgery
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity measurement
- Pupil examination
- Confrontation visual field
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- IOP measurement
- Gonioscopy
- Optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) examination
- Fundus examination
### Diagnostic Testing (Key elements)
- Central corneal thickness (CCT) measurement
- Visual field evaluation. If visual field glaucomatous damage is newly detected in a glaucoma suspect patient, it is best to repeat testing.
- ONH, RNFL, and macular imaging. Clinicians should include all perimetric and other structural information in addition to digital imaging technology when formulating patient management decisions.
### Management Plan for Patients in Whom Therapy is Indicated
- The goal of treatment is to monitor or lower IOP through treatment if an eye is likely to progress to POAG; monitor for structural changes in optic disc and retina; and monitor for functional changes of the optic nerve assessing the visual field.
- The decision to treat a glaucoma suspect patient may arise in various settings (see POAG Suspect PPP for detailed considerations).
- Target IOP is an estimate and must be individualized and/or adjusted during the course of the disease.
- Medical therapy is presently the most common initial intervention to lower IOP (see Table 2 of the POAG Suspect PPP for an overview of options available); consider balance between side effects and effectiveness in choosing a regimen of maximal effectiveness and tolerance to achieve the desired IOP reduction for each patient.
- If a medical therapy fails to reduce IOP sufficiently, then either switching to an alternative medication as monotherapy or adding additional medication is appropriate until the desired IOP level is attained.
### Follow-up Exam History
- Interval ocular history
- Interval systemic medical and medication history
- Side effects of ocular medications if the patient is being treated
- Review of pertinent medication use if the patient is being treated, including the time of the last administration
### Follow-up Physical Exam
- Visual acuity measurement
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- IOP measurement
- Gonioscopy is indicated when there is a suspicion of development of an angle-closure component, anterior chamber shallowing, anterior chamber angle abnormalities, or unexplained change in IOP
### Adjustment of Therapy
- Target IOP is not achieved and the benefits of a change in therapy outweigh the risks for the patient
- The patient is intolerant of the prescribed medical regimen
- The patient does not adhere to the prescribed medical regimen due to costs or other factors
- New systemic conditions or treatments develop that could be a contraindication to the current glaucoma therapy
- The patient under treatment has been stable for a prolonged period without progression to POAG, in which case cautious withdrawal of therapy may be considered
- The patient has converted to POAG (see Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma PPP)
## Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Suspect (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation) (continued)
### Patient Education
- Discuss number and severity of risk factors, prognosis, life expectancy, management plan, and likelihood that therapy, once started, can be continued long term
- Educate about their condition and its potential to lead to glaucoma, the status of their condition, the rationale and goals of intervention, and relative benefits and risks of alternative interventions
- Educate about eyelid closure or nasolacrimal occlusion to reduce systemic absorption after medication instillation
- Encourage patients to alert their ophthalmologist to physical or emotional changes that occur when taking glaucoma medications
- Patients with substantial visual impairment or blindness can be referred for and encouraged to use appropriate vision rehabilitation and social services
## Primary Angle-Closure Disease (Initial Evaluation and Therapy)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Ocular history (e.g., blurred vision, halos around lights, eye pain, headache, eye redness)
- Family history of acute angle-closure crisis (AACC)
- Systemic history (e.g., use of topical or systemic medications)
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Refractive status
- Pupil examination
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy:
  - Conjunctival hyperemia (in acute cases)
  - Central and peripheral anterior chamber depth narrowing
  - Anterior chamber inflammation suggestive of a recent or current attack
  - Corneal swelling (Microcystic edema and stromal edema are common in acute cases)
  - Small corneal diameter (indicative of a smaller eye at greater risk for PACD)
  - Iris abnormalities, including diffuse or focal atrophy, posterior synechiae, abnormal pupillary function, irregular pupil shape, and a mid-dilated pupil (suggestive of a recent or current attack)
  - Lens changes, including cataract and glaukomflecken
  - Corneal endothelial cell loss
- IOP measurement
- Gonioscopy
- Evaluation of fundus and optic nerve head using direct ophthalmoscope or slit-lamp biomicroscope with an indirect lens, the central portion of the gonioscopy lens, or by imaging the retina and optic nerve with photography using a nonmydriatic camera through an undilated pupil
### Diagnostic Testing (Key elements)
- Anterior segment imaging
- Ocular biometry
- Provocative testing
### Management Plan for Patients in Whom Iridotomy is Indicated
- In patients with Primary Angle-Closure Suspect (PACS), iridotomy may be considered to reduce the risk of developing angle closure.
- In acute angle-closure crisis (AACC), use medical therapy first to lower the IOP to reduce pain and to clear corneal edema (see Table 4 of the POAG PPP). Iridotomy should then be performed as soon as possible.
- Laser iridotomy is the preferred surgical treatment for AACC because it has a favorable risk-benefit ratio; but patients with PACS who have not had an iridotomy should be warned of potential risk for AACC and certain medicines could cause pupil dilation and induce AACC.
- Selection of cyclophotocoagulation over other procedures should be left to the discretion of the treating ophthalmologist, in consultation with the individual patient.
- The fellow eye should be scheduled for a prophylactic iridotomy if the chamber angle is anatomically narrow, since approximately half of fellow eyes can develop AACC within 5 years.
- Given the lack of convincing evidence for prophylactic use of iridoplasty in patients with plateau iris, and since iridoplasty can be painful and may cause inflammation, the decision of whether to observe or treat these eyes is left to the judgment of the testing ophthalmologist.
### Perioperative Care for Iridotomy Patients
The ophthalmologist who performs surgery has the following responsibilities:
- Obtain informed consent from the patient or patient’s surrogate decision maker after discussing the risk, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery.
- Ensure that preoperative evaluation confirms the need for surgery.
- Consider the preoperative use of a parasympathomimetic to facilitate LPI.
- Use topical ocular hypotensive agents perioperatively to prevent sudden IOP elevation, particularly for patients who have severe disease.
- Ensure the patency of the iridotomy by directly visualizing fluid flow of aqueous and pigment from the posterior to anterior chamber. Visualization of a red reflex alone is insufficient to confirm patency.
- Enlarge the iridotomy as necessary to achieve diameter of at least 100 microns.
- Perform at least one IOP check immediately prior to surgery and within 30 minutes to 2 hours following surgery.
- Prescribe topical corticosteroids in the postoperative period.
- Ensure that the patient receives adequate postoperative care.
#### Follow-up evaluations include:
- Confirm patency of iridotomy by visualizing zonules, the anterior lens capsule, or ciliary processes.
## Primary Angle-Closure Disease (Initial Evaluation and Therapy) (continued)
- IOP measurement
- Perform dark-room gonioscopy with compression/indentation to assess the extent of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) if it was not performed immediately following iridotomy
- Examine the fundus as clinically indicated
### Follow-up of Patients after Iridotomy
- Patients (with or without glaucomatous optic neuropathy) with a residual open angle or a combination of open angle and some PAS should be followed at appropriate intervals to check for increasing PAS
- If IOP remains elevated long term and patient develops PAC or PACG, then ongoing medical therapy to lower IOP may become necessary (see follow-up procedures and intervals in POAG PPP)
### Patient Education
- Patients with PAS who have not had an iridotomy should be warned of potential risk for AACC and that certain medicines could cause pupil dilation and induce AACC
- Patients should be informed about the symptoms of AACC and instructed to notify their ophthalmologist immediately if symptoms occur
- Patients with substantial visual impairment or blindness can be referred for and encouraged to use appropriate vision rehabilitation and social services
## Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Symptoms (metamorphopsia, decreased vision, scotoma, photopsia, difficulties in dark adaptation)
- Medications and nutritional supplement use
- Ocular history
- Medical history (any hypersensitivity reactions)
- Family history, especially family history of AMD
- Social history, especially quantitative smoking history
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Comprehensive eye examination
- Amsler grid
- Stereoscopic biomicroscopic examination of the macula
### Diagnostic Tests
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is important in diagnosing and managing AMD, particularly with respect to determining the presence of subretinal and intraretinal fluid and in documenting the degree of retinal thickening. Optical coherence tomography defines the cross-sectional architecture of the retina, which is not possible with other imaging technology. It may reveal the presence of fluid that is not apparent on biomicroscopy alone. It also assists in evaluating the response of the retina and RPE to therapy by allowing structural changes to be followed accurately. Newer generation OCT modalities, including SD-OCT and SS-OCT, are preferred technologies.
Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) provides noninvasive evaluation of the retinal and choroidal vasculature and is being more commonly applied in the evaluation and management of AMD, but it has not replaced other angiographic methods.
Intravenous fundus fluorescein angiography is indicated:
- when patient complains of new metamorphopsia
- when patient has unexplained blurred vision
- when clinical exam reveals elevation of the RPE or retina, macular edema, subretinal blood, hard exudates or subretinal fibrosis or the OCT shows evidence of fluid
- to detect the presence of and determine the extent, type, size, and location of MNV
- to guide treatment (laser photocoagulation surgery or verteporfin PDT)
- to detect persistent or recurrent MNV or other retinal diseases following treatment
- to assist in determining the cause of visual loss that is not explained by clinical exam
Each angiographic facility should have a care plan for an emergency and a clear protocol to minimize the risks and to manage complications.
### Follow-up Exam History
- Visual symptoms, including decreased vision and metamorphopsia
- Changes in medications and nutritional supplements
- Changes in ocular history and medical history
- Changes in social history, especially smoking
### Follow-up Physical Exam
- Visual acuity at distance with correction
- Amsler grid
- Stereoscopic biomicroscopic examination of the fundus
### Follow-up after Treatment for Neovascular AMD
- Examine patients treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy approximately at 4-week intervals
- Subsequent examinations, OCT, OCTA, and fluorescein angiography should be performed as indicated depending on the clinical findings and the judgment of the treating ophthalmologist
### Patient Education
- Educate patients about the prognosis and potential value of treatment as appropriate for their visual and functional status
- Encourage patients with early AMD or a family history of AMD to assess their own visual acuity using monocular vision testing and to have regular dilated eye exams for early detection of intermediate AMD
- Educate patients with a high-risk AMD phenotype about methods of detecting new symptoms of MNV and about the need for prompt notification to an ophthalmologist
- Instruct patients with unilateral disease to monitor their vision in their fellow eye and to return periodically even in absence of symptoms, but promptly after onset of new or significant visual symptoms
- Instruct patients to report symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, including eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, increased sensitivity to light, or increased number of floaters promptly
- Strongly recommend to patients who are currently smoking to stop because there are observational data that support a causal relationship between smoking and AMD and other considerable health benefits of smoking cessation
## Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Management Recommendations)
- Inform patients who have been instructed by their physician that long-term aspirin is appropriate and beneficial to continue with aspirin therapy as prescribed.
- Refer patients with reduced visual function for vision rehabilitation ([see www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](http://www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab)) and social services.
#### TABLE 5
**Risk for Progression of Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Treatments by Severity Level**
| Stage of AMD                                  | Risk of Progression to Advanced AMD (approximately)*         | Treatment Options                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| No drusen (AREDS category 1)                  | 5-year risk 0.5%, 10-year risk 1.5%                         | None                                                      |
| Early AMD (AREDS category 2)                  | 5-year risk 4%, 10-year risk 8%                             | None                                                      |
| Intermediate AMD (AREDS category 3) Without Pigment OU | 5-year risk 9%, 10-year risk 28%                             | AREDS2 antioxidant supplements**                          |
| Advanced AMD – GA (AREDS category 4)          | 5-year risk 45%, 10-year risk 71%                           | Consider intravitreal medication                          |
| Advanced AMD – MNV (AREDS category 4)         | 5-year risk 45%, 10-year risk 71%                           | Anti-VEGF intravitreal injections may be recommended       |
| Extrafoveal Choroidal Neovascularization in AMD (AREDS category 4) | 5-year risk 45%, 10-year risk 71%                           | Anti-VEGF intravitreal injections or laser surgery may be recommended |
AMD = Age-Related Macular Degeneration; Anti-VEGF = Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor; GA = geographic atrophy; MNV = macular neovascularization.
*The risk of progression to advanced AMD is based on the simplified severity scale and based on the AREDS cohort aged 55 to 80 years of age.
**The AREDS design included participants ages 55–80 years old.
## Diabetic Retinopathy (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Duration of diabetes
- Past glycemic control (HbA1c)
- Medications
- Medical history (e.g., obesity, renal disease, systemic hypertension, serum lipid levels, pregnancy, neuropathy, cystic fibrosis)
- Ocular history (e.g., trauma, other eye diseases, ocular injections, surgery, including retinal laser surgery)
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- Measurement of IOP
- Gonioscopy before dilation when indicated (for neovascularization of the iris or increased IOP)
- Pupillary assessment for optic nerve dysfunction
- Thorough fundoscopy including stereoscopic examination of the posterior pole
- Examination of the peripheral retina and vitreous, best performed with indirect ophthalmoscopy or with slit-lamp biomicroscopy
### Diagnosis
- Classify both eyes as to category and severity of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. Each category has an inherent risk for progression and is dependent on adherence to overall diabetes control.
### Follow-up History
- Visual symptoms
- Systemic status (pregnancy, blood pressure, serum lipids, renal status)
- Glycemic status (HbA1c)
- Other treatments (dialysis, fenofibrates)
### Follow-up Physical Exam
- Visual acuity
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with iris examination
- Measurement of IOP
- Gonioscopy (preferably before dilation when iris neovascularization is suspected or if IOP is elevated)
- Stereoscopic examination of the posterior pole after dilation of the pupils
- Examination of the peripheral retina and vitreous when indicated
- OCT imaging when appropriate
### Ancillary Tests
- Color fundus photography may be useful for documenting the severity of the diabetes, the presence of NVE and NVD, the response to treatment, and the need for additional treatment at future visits. Widefield imaging can be helpful in documenting overall DR burden.
- Optical coherence tomography can be used to quantify retinal thickness, monitor macular edema, identify vitreomacular traction, and detect other forms of macular disease in patients with diabetic macular edema. Decisions to treat with anti-VEGF injections, change therapeutic agents (e.g., use of intraocular corticosteroids), initiate laser surgery treatment, or even consider vitrectomy surgery are often based in part on OCT findings.
- Fluorescein angiography is not indicated as a part of the regular examination of patients with diabetes. Use of focal laser surgery has decreased. FA is useful to differentiate DME from other macular disease or for patients with unexplained vision loss. Angiography can identify macular capillary nonperfusion as an explanation for vision loss that is unresponsive to therapy and may detect areas of untreated retinal capillary nonperfusion that explain persistent retinal or disc neovascularization after previous scatter laser surgery.
- Optical coherence tomography angiography offers a noninvasive nature and the ability to visualize depth-resolved, capillary-level abnormalities in the three retinal plexuses, offering a much more quantitative assessment of macular ischemia. Although the technology is FDA approved, the guidelines and indications for use in diabetic retinopathy are evolving.
- Ultrasonography enables assessment of the status of the retina in the presence of a vitreous hemorrhage or other media opacity, and may be helpful to define the amount of vitreous hemorrhage, the extent and severity of vitreoretinal traction, and diagnose diabetic retinal detachments in the setting of media opacity.
- Other tests may include electroretinography (to evaluate neural dysfunction of the retina) and visual field testing (to detect retinal dysfunction). Artificial intelligence is being evaluated as an adjunct to monitor and predict disease progression.
## Diabetic Retinopathy (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation) (continued)
### Patient Education
- Discuss results of exam and implications
- Encourage patients with diabetes but without diabetic retinopathy to have annual dilated eye exams
- Inform patients that effective treatment for diabetic retinopathy depends on timely intervention, despite good vision and no ocular symptoms, and that current treatments often require multiple visits and evaluations over time for adequate delivery of therapeutic effect
- Educate patients about the importance of maintaining near-normal glucose levels and near-normal blood pressure and lowering serum lipid levels
- Communicate with the attending physician, e.g., family physician, internist, or endocrinologist, regarding eye examination findings
- Provide patients whose conditions fail to respond to surgery and for whom further treatment is unavailable with professional support and offer referral for counseling, rehabilitative, or social services as appropriate

*Notes:*
- **Anti-VEGF** = anti-vascular endothelial growth factor; CI-DME = center-involved diabetic macular edema; NCI-DME = noncenter-involved diabetic macular edema; NPDR = nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy; PDR = proliferative diabetic retinopathy
- *Treatments that may be considered include intravitreal corticosteroids or anti-VEGF agents. Data from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network in 2011 demonstrated that, at two years of follow-up, intravitreal ranibizumab with prompt or deferred laser surgery resulted in greater visual acuity gain and intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide plus laser surgery also resulted in greater visual gain in pseudophakic eyes compared with laser surgery alone. Individuals receiving the intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents may be re-examined as early as one month following injection.*
- † For patients with good visual acuity (20/25 or better) and NCI-DME, there is no difference between observation plus aflibercept if visual acuity decreases, focal laser surgery plus aflibercept if visual acuity decreases, or anti-VEGF treatment. It is appropriate to defer treatment until visual acuity is worse than 20/25. Exceptions include hypertension or fluid retention associated with heart failure, renal failure, pregnancy, or any other causes that may aggravate macular edema. Deferral of photocoagulation for a brief period of medical treatment may be considered in these cases. Also, deferral of NCI-DME treatment is an option when the visual acuity is excellent (better than 20/32), close follow-up is possible, and the patient understands the risks.*
- ‡ Or shorter intervals if signs approaching those of severe NPDR appear.
## Idiopathic Epiretinal Membrane and Vitreomacular Traction
### (Initial Evaluation and Therapy)
### Initial Exam (Key elements)
- Ocular history (e.g., posterior vitreous detachment, uveitis, retinal breaks, retinal vein occlusions, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, ocular inflammatory diseases, recent wound healing)
- Duration of symptoms (e.g., metamorphopsia, difficulty using both eyes together, and diplopia)
- Systemic history
### Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the macula, vitreoretinal interface, and optic disc
- An indirect peripheral retinal examination with scleral depression to evaluate for retinal breaks and pathology
- Amsler grid test
- Watzke-Allen test
### Diagnostic Tests
- OCT to diagnose and characterize VMA, ERM, VMT, and associated retinal changes
- Fluorescein angiogram or OCTA may be helpful to evaluate ERMs and/or VMT
### Management Plan
- The decision to intervene surgically in patients with ERM/VMT usually depends upon the severity of symptoms, especially the impact on daily activities
- Patients should be informed that the majority of ERMs will remain stable and do not require therapy
- Patients should be reassured that there is a very successful surgical procedure that could address worsening symptoms or decreasing visual acuity
- Risks versus benefits of vitrectomy surgery should be discussed. Risks include decreased visual acuity, cataract, retinal tears, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis
### Surgery and Postoperative Care
- Vitrectomy surgery is often indicated in patients who are affected by a decrease in visual acuity, metamorphopsia, double vision, or difficulty using their eyes together
- Patients should be examined postoperatively day 1, and again 1 to 2 weeks following surgery, or sooner depending upon the development of new symptoms or new findings during early postoperative examination
### Follow-up Physical Exam:
- Interval history, including new symptoms
- Measurement of IOP
- Slit lamp biomicroscopy of anterior segment
- Indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy of peripheral retina
- Counseling on use of postoperative medications
- Counseling on signs and symptoms of retinal detachment
- Precautions on intraocular gas if used
- Referral to a strabismus specialist or orthoptist (if indicated)
### Patient Education and Follow-up
- Comparing OCT images in the abnormal versus normal eye can aid patient understanding
- Patients should be encouraged to periodically test their central vision monocularly to detect changes that may occur over time, like increasing metamorphopsia and/or development of a small central scotoma
- Patients should be informed to notify their ophthalmologist promptly if they have symptoms such as an increase of floaters, loss of visual field, metamorphopsia, or a decrease in visual acuity
- Patients with functionally limiting postoperative visual impairment should be referred for vision rehabilitation (see www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab) and social services
## Idiopathic Macular Hole (Initial Evaluation and Therapy)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Duration of symptoms such as reduced visual acuity, metamorphopsia, floaters, micropsia, central scotoma
- Ocular history: glaucoma, retinal detachment or tear, other eye diseases, eye or head injuries, ocular surgery, or sun or eclipse gazing or use of a laser pointer or other laser
- Medications that may be related to macular cystoid edema (e.g., systemic niacin, topical prostaglandin analogues, topical epinephrine, tamoxifen)
### Examination (Key elements)
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of the macula and the vitreoretinal interface
- Indirect peripheral retinal examination
- Amsler grid test
- Watzke-Allen test
### Ancillary Test
- OCT is extremely helpful and offers detailed information about the macular anatomy size if an FTMH is present, and presence of any VMT or epiretinal membrane. This information aids in diagnosis, staging, and follow-up.
### Management Recommendations for Macular Hole
| Stage   | Management                 | Follow-up                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-A and 1-B | Observation                | - Follow-up at 2–4 month intervals in the absence of new symptoms <br> - Recommend prompt return if new visual symptoms develop <br> - Encourage monocular visual acuity testing with Amsler grid |
| 2       | Pneumatic Vitreolysis*      | - Performed usually within a few weeks to months of diagnosis <br> - Follow up at 1–2 days, then 1 week or sooner if new visual symptoms <br> - Frequency and timing of subsequent postoperative visits varies depending on the outcome of surgery and the patient’s clinical course |
| 2       | Vitreoretinal surgery†      | - Performed usually within a few weeks to months of diagnosis to minimize risk of progression of macular hole and vision loss <br> - Routine postoperative follow-up at 1–2 days, then 1–2 weeks during which time strict face down positioning is advised <br> - Frequency and timing of subsequent postoperative visits varies depending on the outcome of surgery and the patient’s clinical course |
| 3 or 4  | Vitreoretinal surgery       | - Performed usually within a few weeks to a few months of diagnosis <br> - Postoperative follow-up at 1–2 days, then 1–2 weeks during which time strict face down positioning is advised <br> - Frequency and timing of subsequent postoperative visits varies depending on the outcome of surgery and the patient’s clinical course |
*Several small case series have shown promising results with this technique for smaller holes
†Although surgery is usually performed, observation may also be appropriate in selected cases such as smaller holes and/or better visual acuity
### Surgical and Postoperative Care if Patient Receives Treatment
- Patients should be informed about relative risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery, including the risk of cataract development or progression, and the need for use of expansile intraocular gas or facedown positioning postoperatively
- Formulate a postoperative care plan and inform the patient of these arrangements
- Patients should be informed of possible postoperative increase in IOP
- Examine postoperatively within 1 or 2 days and again 1 to 2 weeks after surgery
- Components of follow-up visit should include interval history, visual acuity measurement, measurement of IOP, slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior chamber and central retina, and indirect ophthalmoscopy of the peripheral retina, and OCT evaluation to document post-op macular anatomy
## Idiopathic Macular Hole
### (Initial Evaluation and Therapy) (continued)
### Patient Education
- Patients should be informed to notify their ophthalmologist promptly if they have symptoms such as an increase in floaters, a loss of visual field, metamorphopsia, or a decrease in visual acuity.
- Patients should be informed that air travel, travel to higher or lower altitudes, or general anesthesia with nitrous oxide should be avoided until the gas tamponade is nearly completely gone.
- Patients who have had a macular hole in one eye should be informed that they have a 10% to 15% chance of macular hole formation in the fellow eye, especially if the vitreous remains attached.
- Patients with functionally limiting postoperative visual impairment should be referred for vision rehabilitation (see [www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab)) and social services.
## Posterior Vitreous Detachment, Retinal Breaks and Lattice Degeneration (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Symptoms of PVD
- Family history of RRD, related genetic disorders (e.g., Stickler syndrome)
- Prior ocular trauma
- History of myopia
- History of ocular surgery including refractive lens exchange and cataract surgery
- History of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy
- History of intravitreal injection
### Ophthalmic Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity testing
- Confrontation visual field examination
- Pupillary assessment for the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect
- Examination of the vitreous for hemorrhage, detachment, and pigmented cells
- Examination of the peripheral fundus using scleral depression. The preferred method of evaluating peripheral vitreoretinal pathology is with indirect ophthalmoscopy combined with scleral depression.
### Diagnostic Tests
- Optical coherence tomography may be helpful to evaluate and stage the PVD
- Perform B-scan ultrasonography if peripheral retina cannot be evaluated
- If no abnormalities are found, frequent follow-up examinations are recommended (i.e., every 1-2 weeks initially)
### Management
- Patients should be informed about the relative risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery
### Follow-up History
- Changes in visual symptoms
- Interval history of eye trauma, intraocular injection, or intraocular surgery
### Follow-up Physical Exam
- Visual acuity
- Evaluation of the vitreous status, with attention to the presence of pigment, hemorrhage, or syneresis
- Examination of the peripheral fundus with scleral depression or a fundus contact or non-contact lens using the slit-lamp biomicroscope
- Wide-field photography may help but does not replace careful ophthalmoscopy
- Optical coherence tomography if vitreomacular traction is present and to document presence of a developing PVD
- B-scan ultrasonography if the media are opaque
### Patient Education
- Patients at high risk of developing retinal detachment should be educated about the symptoms of PVD and retinal detachment and the value of periodic follow-up exams
- Patients who undergo refractive surgery should be informed they remain at risk of RRD despite reduction of their refractive error

## Retinal and Ophthalmic Artery Occlusions (Initial Evaluation and Therapy)
### History (Key elements)
- Duration of vision loss
- Symptoms of GCA (e.g., vision loss, headaches, scalp tenderness, malaise, fatigue, temporal tenderness, jaw claudication, weakness, fever, myalgia, and diplopia)
- Medications
- Family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, systemic hypertension, or hyperlipidemia
- Medical history (e.g., systemic hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hemoglobinopathy and polymyalgia rheumatica) or drug history (e.g., cocaine)
- Ocular history (e.g., trauma, other eye diseases, ocular injections, surgery)
- Social history (e.g., smoking)
### Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- Measurement of IOP
- Gonioscopy when IOP is elevated or when iris neovascularization risk is suspected (prior to dilation)
- Relative afferent pupil defect assessment
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the posterior pole
- Examination of the peripheral retina using indirect ophthalmoscopy through a dilated pupil to assess: retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, retinal emboli, retinal vascular “boxcarring,” and optic disc neovascularization and/or neovascularization elsewhere
### Diagnostic Tests
These may be considered but should not delay transfer to a stroke center in cases of acute, nonarteritic RAO:
- Color and red-free fundus photography
- OCT
- OCT angiography
- Fluorescein angiography
- Indocyanine green angiography
- Ultrasonography in the setting of significant media opacity (to rule out other acute causes of vision loss)
- Ophthalmodynamometry
### Care Management
- Physicians should first consider GCA in patients 50 years of age or older
- In cases of GCA, physicians should consider urgent systemic corticosteroid therapy to prevent vision loss in the fellow eye or vascular occlusion elsewhere
- Patients with diabetes with GCA should be carefully monitored since systemic corticosteroid treatment may destabilize glucose control
- Ophthalmologists should refer patients with retinal vascular disease to the appropriate setting, depending on the nature of the retinal occlusion
- Acute, symptomatic OAO, CRAO, and BRAO from embolic etiologies should prompt an immediate referral to the nearest stroke center or emergency department for prompt assessment for consideration of intervention
- When presented with an asymptomatic BRAO, clinicians should conduct a systemic evaluation (careful medical history, assessment for systemic disease), preferably in conjunction with the patient’s internist
### Patient Follow-up
- Follow-up should consider the extent of retinal or ocular ischemia neovascularization. Patients with greater ischemia require more frequent follow-up.
- Many patients with retinal vascular disease will lose substantial vision despite various treatment options and should be referred for appropriate social services and vision rehabilitation (see [aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](https://www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab))
- Follow-up evaluation includes a history (symptoms, systemic conditions) and examination (visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy with iris examination, measurement of IOP, undilated gonioscopy for iris and angle neovascularization especially when IOP is elevated, biomicroscopic exam of posterior pole after dilation, and peripheral retinal vitreous exam when indicated). Diagnostic tests can be considered: OCT imaging, OCTA, fluorescein angiography, or fundus photography
- Patients with asymptomatic BRAO and/or asymptomatic arterial plaque should be referred to a primary care physician
## Retinal Vein Occlusions (Initial Evaluation and Therapy)
### Initial Exam (Key elements)
- Location and duration of vision loss
- Current medications, history of smoking, recreational drug use
- Medical history (e.g., systemic hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, coagulopathies, thrombotic disorders, pulmonary embolus)
- Ocular history (e.g., glaucoma, other ophthalmologic disorders, ocular injections, surgery, including retinal laser surgery, cataract surgery, refractive surgery)
### Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity
- Pupillary assessment for relative afferent pupillary defect that corresponds to level of ischemia and predictive risk for neovascularization
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy for fine, abnormal, new iris vessels
- Measurement of IOP
- Gonioscopy prior to dilation, especially in cases of an ischemic CRVO, when IOP is elevated, or when iris neovascularization risk is high
- Binocular funduscopic evaluation of the posterior pole
- Examination of the peripheral retina and vitreous. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy is recommended to evaluate retinopathy of the posterior pole and midperipheral retina. Examination of the far peripheral retina is best performed using indirect or a three-mirror contact lens.
### Diagnostic Tests
- Color red-free fundus photography for documenting the severity of the retinal findings, NVE, extent of intraretinal hemorrhages and NVD
- Optical coherence tomography to detect the presence and extent of macular edema, vitreoretinal interface changes and subretinal fluid
- Fluorescein angiography to evaluate extent of vascular occlusion, degree of ischemia, and extent of macular edema
- Optical coherence tomography angiography to detect capillary nonperfusion, enlarged foveal avascular zone, and vascular abnormalities
- Ultrasonography (e.g., when vitreous hemorrhage is present)
- Artificial intelligence is being evaluated to identify RVO and is demonstrating good performance in recognizing RVO from color fundus photographs with deep learning algorithms
### Care Management
- Optimizing control of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and IOP are important to manage risk factors
- Systemic reviews have shown the efficacy of anti-VEGF agents in treating macular edema associated with RVO
- Laser surgery treatment remains a viable treatment in eyes with BRVO
- Peripheral panretinal photocoagulation is still recommended for neovascularization when complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or iris neovascularization occur
- Ophthalmologists caring for patients with retinal vascular occlusion should be familiar with specific recommendations of relevant clinical trials due to the complexity of diagnosis and treatment
### Patient Follow-up
- Follow-up evaluation includes a history of changes in symptoms and systemic status (pregnancy, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and blood glucose) and examination (visual acuity, undilated slit-lamp biomicroscopy and gonioscopy) monthly for 6 months with CRVO and in eyes with ischemic CRVO after discontinuing anti-VEGF to detect neovascularization, pupillary assessment for a relative afferent pupillary defect, measurement of IOP, stereoscopic exam of posterior pole at dilation, OCT imaging, peripheral retina and vitreous exam when indicated, and fluorescein angiography
- Ophthalmologists should refer patients with an RVO to a primary care physician for appropriate management of their systemic condition and communicate results to the physician managing the patient’s ongoing care
- Risk to the fellow eye should be communicated to both the primary care provider and the patient
- Patients whose conditions fail to respond to therapy and when further treatment is unavailable should be provided with professional support and offered a referral for counseling, vision rehabilitation, or social services as appropriate ([www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](http://www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab))
## Cataract (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Symptoms
- Ocular history
- Systemic history
- Assessment of visual function status
- Medications currently used
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity with current correction
- Measurement of BCVA (with refraction)
- External examination
- Ocular alignment and motility
- Glare testing when indicated
- Pupil reactivity and function
- Measurement of IOP
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- Dilated examination of the cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens, macula, peripheral retina, optic nerve, and vitreous through a dilated pupil
- Indirect ophthalmoscopy
- Assessment of relevant aspects of the patient’s medical and physical status
### Care Management
- Treatment is indicated when visual function no longer meets the patient’s needs and cataract surgery provides a reasonable likelihood of improvement
- Cataract removal is also indicated when:
  - Clinically significant anisometropia
  - Interference with diagnosis or management of posterior segment pathology
  - Lens causes inflammation and secondary glaucoma
  - Lens induces primary angle closure or other lens-related glaucoma
- Surgery should not be performed under the following circumstances:
  - Tolerable refractive correction provides vision that meets the patient’s needs and desires
  - Surgery is not expected to improve visual function, and no other indication for lens removal exists
  - The patient cannot safely undergo surgery because of coexisting medical or ocular conditions
  - Appropriate postoperative care cannot be arranged
- Patient or patient’s surrogate decision maker is unable to give informed consent for nonemergent surgery
- Indications for second eye surgery are the same as for the first eye (with considerations given to needs for binocular function)
- Most cataract surgery in the US is performed by small-incision phacoemulsification with foldable IOL implantation on an outpatient basis
- There is substantial evidence that intracameral antibiotic administration reduces the risk of postop endophthalmitis. Increasing evidence suggests topical antibiotics do not add to benefit of intracameral injections.
### Preoperative Care
The ophthalmologist who is to perform the surgery has the following responsibilities:
- Examine the patient preoperatively
- Ensure that the evaluation accurately documents symptoms, findings, and indications for treatment
- Inform the patient about the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery, including surgical experience and anticipated refractive outcome
- Review results of presurgical and diagnostic evaluations with the patient
- Counsel the patient about postoperative refractive options
- Counsel the patient about elective refraction options and postoperative refractive enhancement
- Consider effect of ocular comorbidities, including upper eyelid blepharoptosis
- Formulate surgical plan, including preoperative management, selection of surgical approach, anesthesia, IOL design and power
- Assess relevant aspects of the patient’s mental and physical status
- Formulate postoperative plans and inform patient of arrangements
- Answer the patient’s questions regarding surgery, care, and cost
- Routine preoperative laboratory testing in association with the history and physical examination is not indicated
## Cataract (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation) (continued)
### Follow-up Evaluation
- Functionally monocular and high-risk patients should be seen within 24 hours of surgery.
- Routine patients should be seen within 48 hours of surgery.
- Frequency and timing of subsequent visits depend on size or configuration of the incision; need to cut or remove sutures; and when refraction, visual function, and medical condition of the eye are stabilized.
- More frequent follow-up usually necessary for high-risk patients.
- Components of each postoperative exam should include:
  - Interval history, including new symptoms, use of postoperative medications and self-assessment of vision.
  - Measurement of visual function.
  - Measurement of IOP.
  - Slit-lamp biomicroscopy.
  - Counseling/education for the patient.
  - Provision of a management plan.
  - Operating ophthalmologist has ultimate responsibility for preoperative assessment and postoperative care of the patient and has a unique perspective and thorough understanding of the patient’s intraoperative course, postoperative condition and response to surgery. The operating ophthalmologist has an ethical obligation to the patient that continues until postoperative rehabilitation is complete. The operating ophthalmologist should provide postoperative care that is within the unique competence of the ophthalmologist. Patients should always have access to an ophthalmologist for appropriate care if serious problems arise.
### Nd:YAG Laser Capsulotomy
- Treatment is indicated when vision impaired by posterior capsular opacification does not meet the patient’s functional needs or when it critically interferes with visualization of the fundus.
- The decision to perform capsulotomy should take into account the benefits and risks of the laser surgery. This might be indicated earlier in patients with multifocal IOLs because of a greater functional impact of early PCO. Laser posterior capsulotomy should not be performed prophylactically (i.e., when the capsule remains clear). The eye should be inflammation free and the IOL stable prior to performing laser capsulotomy.
- Educate high-risk patients about the symptoms of retinal tears and detachment.
## Bacterial Keratitis (Initial Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History
- Ocular symptoms (e.g., degree of pain, redness, discharge, blurred vision, photophobia, duration of symptoms, circumstances surrounding the onset of symptoms)
- Contact lens history (e.g., wearing schedule, overnight wear, type of contact lenses, contact lens solution, homemade saline, contact lens hygiene protocol, tap-water rinse of contact lenses, swimming, using a hot tub, or showering while wearing contact lenses, method of purchase, such as over the Internet, and decorative contact lens use)
- Review of other ocular history, including risk factors such as herpes simplex virus keratitis, varicella zoster virus keratitis, previous bacterial keratitis, trauma, dry eye, recurrent corneal erosion, and previous ocular surgery, including refractive and facial (including laser cosmetic and blepharoplasty) surgery
- Review of other medical problems, including immune status, rosacea, atopy, diabetes, systemic medications, and history of methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* or other multidrug-resistant infection
- Current and recently used ocular and systemic medications
- Medication allergies
### Initial Physical Exam
- Visual acuity
- General appearance of patient, including skin conditions, hands, and overall hygiene
- Facial examination (rosacea, herpes zoster)
- Globe position
- Eyelids and eyelid closure
- Conjunctiva (injection, chemosis)
- Nasolacrimal apparatus
- Corneal sensation if appropriate
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy:
  - Eyelid
  - Conjunctiva
  - Sclera
  - Cornea
  - Anterior chamber for depth and the presence of inflammation, including cell and flare, fibrin, hyphema, and hypopyon
  - Anterior vitreous for depth and the presence of inflammation
  - Contralateral eye for clues to etiology as well as possible similar underlying pathology
### Diagnostic Tests
- Manage majority of community-acquired cases with empiric therapy and without smears or cultures
- Indications for smears and cultures:
  - Corneal infiltrate that is central, large, and/or associated with significant stromal involvement or melting
  - ≥1+ cells in anterior chamber
  - History of corneal surgery
  - Atypical clinical features suggestive of fungal, amoebic, or mycobacterial keratitis
  - Multiple corneal infiltrates
- The hypopyon that occurs in eyes with bacterial keratitis is usually sterile, and aqueous or vitreous taps should not be performed unless there is a high suspicion of microbial endophthalmitis, such as following an intraocular surgery, perforating trauma, or sepsis
- Corneal scrapings for culture should be inoculated directly onto appropriate culture media to maximize culture yield. If this is not feasible, place specimens in transport media. In either case, immediately incubate cultures or take promptly to the laboratory.
### Care Management
- Topical antibiotic eye drops are capable of achieving high tissue levels, a preferred method of treatment in most cases
- Single-drug therapy using a fluoroquinolone is as effective as combination therapy utilizing fortified antibiotics. Fortified topical antibiotics to be considered for large and/or visually significant corneal infiltrates, especially if hypopyon is present. Combination fortified-antibiotic therapy is an alternative, especially for severe infection and eyes unresponsive to initial treatment. There is no difference found in corneal perforation rates across classes of topical antibiotics.
- Topical corticosteroid therapy may have a beneficial role, but much of the literature has not shown a difference in clinical outcome
- Subconjunctival antibiotics may be helpful where adherence is questionable or there is a delay in obtaining fortified antibiotics
- For central or severe keratitis (e.g., deep stromal involvement or an infiltrate larger than 2 mm with extensive suppuration), use a loading dose (e.g., every 5 to 15 minutes), followed by frequent applications (e.g., every hour is recommended). Severe cases should be followed daily initially, at least until stable or improvement is confirmed.
## Bacterial Keratitis (Initial Evaluation) (continued)
- Systemic therapy is necessary for gonococcal keratitis. It may be considered in severe cases where the infectious process has extended or the cornea is perforated.
- For patients treated with ocular topical corticosteroids at time of presentation of suspected bacterial keratitis, reduce or eliminate corticosteroids until infection has been controlled.
- When the corneal infiltrate compromises the visual axis, may add topical corticosteroid therapy following at least 2 to 3 days of progressive improvement with treatment with topical antibiotics typically after pathogen identification.
- Examine patients within 1 to 2 days after initiation of topical corticosteroid therapy and monitor intraocular pressure.
- In general, modify the initial regimen if there is lack of improvement or stabilization within 48 hours.
## Bacterial Keratitis (Management Recommendations)
### Patient Education
- Inform patients with risk factors predisposing them to bacterial keratitis of their relative risk, the signs and symptoms of infection, and to consult an ophthalmologist promptly if they experience such warning signs or symptoms.
- Educate about the severe visual impairment from bacterial keratitis and need for strict adherence to the therapeutic regimen.
- Discuss possibility of permanent visual loss and need for future visual rehabilitation.
- Educate patients with contact lenses about increased risk of infection associated with contact lens, overnight wear, and importance of adherence to techniques to promote contact lens hygiene.
- Refer patients with significant visual impairment or blindness for vision rehabilitation if they are not surgical candidates (see [https://www.aao.org/education/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](https://www.aao.org/education/low-vision-and-vision-rehab)).

- Unilateral or bilateral presentation
- Exacerbating conditions (e.g., smoke, allergens, wind, contact lenses, low humidity, retinoids, diet and alcohol consumption, eye makeup, aqueous tear deficiency)
- Symptoms related to systemic diseases (e.g., rosacea, atopy, herpes zoster Ophthalmicus, psoriasis, and graft-versus-host disease)
- Current and previous systemic and topical medications (e.g., antihistamines or drugs with anticholinergic effects, or drugs used in the past such as isotretinoin that might have an effect on the ocular surface)
- Recent exposure to an infected individual (e.g., pediculosis palpebrarum [P. pubis])
- Ocular history
- Medical history
### Initial Physical Exam

### Diagnostic Tests
- Cultures may be indicated for patients with recurrent anterior blepharitis with severe inflammation as well as for patients who are not responding to therapy
- Biopsy of the eyelid to exclude the possibility of carcinoma may be indicated in cases of marked asymmetry, resistance to therapy or unifocal recurrent chalazia that do not respond well to therapy
- Consult with the pathologist prior to obtaining the biopsy if sebaceous cell carcinoma is suspected
### Care Management
- Treat patients with blepharitis initially with a regimen of warm compresses and eyelid cleansing
- A topical antibiotic such as bacitracin or erythromycin can be prescribed to be applied one or more times daily or at bedtime on the eyelid margins for a few weeks
- For patients with meibomian gland dysfunction, whose chronic symptoms and signs are not adequately controlled with eyelid cleansing or meibomian gland expression, oral tetracyclines and topical antibiotics may be helpful
- Topical azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, brimonidine, doxycycline, and isotretinoin are effective treatments for patients with systemic rosacea (↑, GQ, SR)
- A brief course of topical corticosteroids may be helpful for eyelid or ocular surface inflammation including marginal keratitis, or phlyctenules. The minimal effective dose of corticosteroid should be utilized and long-term corticosteroid therapy should be avoided if possible.
- An eyelid tumor should be suspected in patients with atypical eyelid-margin inflammation or disease not responsive to medical therapy, and these patients should be carefully re-evaluated
### Follow-Up Evaluation
- Follow-up visits should include:
  - Interval history
  - Measurement of visual acuity
  - External examination
  - Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- If corticosteroid therapy is prescribed, re-evaluate patient within a few weeks to determine the response to therapy, measure intraocular pressure, and assess treatment compliance
### Patient Education
- Counsel patients about the chronicity and recurrence of the disease process
- Inform patients that symptoms can frequently be improved but are rarely eliminated
- Patients with an inflammatory eyelid lesion that appears suspicious for malignancy should be referred to an appropriate specialist
## Conjunctivitis (Initial Evaluation)

### Diagnostic Tests
- Cultures are indicated in all cases of suspected infectious neonatal conjunctivitis
- Cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing may be helpful for recurrent, severe, or chronic purulent conjunctivitis in any age group and where conjunctivitis has not responded to medication
- Smears for cytology and special stains are recommended in cases of suspected infectious neonatal conjunctivitis, chronic or recurrent conjunctivitis, and gonococcal conjunctivitis in any age group
- Confirm diagnosis of adult and neonate chlamydial conjunctivitis with laboratory testing
- Conjunctival biopsy and immunofluorescent staining diagnostic tests may be helpful when ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid or paraneoplastic syndrome is suspected
- A full-thickness lid biopsy is indicated in cases of suspected sebaceous carcinoma
- Thyroid antibody tests are indicated for patients with superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis who do not have known thyroid disease
## Conjunctivitis (Management Recommendations)
### Care Management
- The majority of cases in the adult population are viral and self-limited, and do not require antimicrobial treatment. There is no proven effective treatment for eradication of adenoviral infection; artificial tears, topical antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, oral analgesics or cold compresses may mitigate symptoms. The use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential adverse treatment effects.
- Allergen-specific immunotherapy is beneficial in reducing allergic conjunctivitis, more so in children than in adults.
- Treat mild allergic conjunctivitis with an over-the-counter antihistamine/vasoconstrictor agent or second-generation topical histamine H1-receptor antagonists. If the condition is frequently recurrent or persistent, mast-cell stabilizers can be used. New medications combine antihistamine activity with mast-cell stabilizing properties.
- Treatment for viral conjunctivitis include modifying the environment and use of cold compresses and ocular lubricants. For acute exacerbations, topical corticosteroids are usually needed to control severe symptoms (*-, MQ, SR*).
- For contact lens-related keratoconjunctivitis, discontinue contact lens wear until the cornea returns to normal. In mild cases, a brief course of topical corticosteroids, in addition to longer-term use of topical cyclosporine can be considered.
- Use systemic antibiotic treatment for conjunctivitis due to *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* or *Chlamydia trachomatis*.
- Treat sexual partners to minimize recurrence and spread of disease when conjunctivitis is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and refer patients and their sexual partners to an appropriate medical specialist.
- Refer patients with manifestation of a systemic disease to an appropriate medical specialist.
### Follow-Up Evaluation
- Follow-up visits should include:
  - Interval history
  - Visual acuity
  - Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- If corticosteroids are used, perform baseline and periodic measurement of IOP and pupillary dilation to evaluate for glaucoma and cataract.
### Patient Education
- Counsel patients with contagious varieties to minimize or prevent spread of disease and encourage minimization of contact with other people for 10 to 14 days after onset of symptoms in the community.
- Inform patients who may require repeat short-term therapy with topical corticosteroid of potential complications of corticosteroid use.
- Advise patients with allergic conjunctivitis that hypoallergenic bedding, eyelid cleansers to remove allergens, frequent clothes washing and bathing/showering before bedtime may be helpful.
## Corneal Ectasia (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History
- Disease onset and course: varies with type and degree of thinning disorder
- Vision (degree of impairment): varies with degree of findings on topography and tomography
- Ocular history: changes in glasses prescription, especially one year more than the fellow eye, type and duration of contact lens wear, noting stability and comfort of lens, history of keratorefractive surgery
- Medical history: history of atopy associated with eye rubbing, asthma and hay fever
- Family history: first-degree relatives with keratoconus, genetic syndromes such as Down syndrome, Leber congenital amaurosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Noonan syndrome
### Initial Physical Exam
- Visual function assessment
- External examination
  - Eyelid skin
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
  - Presence, extent, and location of corneal thinning or protrusion
  - Evidence of previous ocular surgery
  - Vogt striae
  - Prominent corneal nerves
  - Fleischer ring
  - Evidence of corneal scarring or previous hydrops
- IOP measurement
- Fundus examination: assessment of red reflex for dark area, and retina for tapetoretinal degenerations
### Diagnostic Tests
- Keratometry
- Corneal topography and tomography
  - Topographic power map
  - Tomographic elevation map
- Optical coherence tomography
### Care Management
- Therapy is tailored to the individual patient, depending on the visual impairment and a risk/benefit analysis of each treatment option
- Vision can be corrected with eyeglasses, but contact lenses may be required as keratoconus progresses to correct vision and reduce distortion
- Rigid corneal gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses can mask corneal irregularities. Hybrid contact lenses provide higher oxygen permeability and greater RGP/hydrogel junction strength. Piggyback contact lenses may be employed for greater comfort and less epithelial disruption. Scleral lenses may be useful when other contact lenses fail to achieve a good fit due to lens decentration.
- Corneal cross-linking (CXL) has long-term data supporting its safety and stability and should be considered for patients in early stages of progressive keratoconus
- Intrastromal corneal ring segment implantation can improve uncorrected and corrected visual acuity, reduce high-order corneal aberrations, and facilitate fitting of contact lenses. They are not indicated in subclinical disease and don’t alter disease progression.
- Lamellar keratoplasty using deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty can be considered for contact-lens-intolerant patients or patients with inadequate visual function. The benefit is that it preserves the host endothelial layer and has less stringent tissue requirements than penetrating keratoplasty.
- Persistent corneal edema following hydrops is an indication for full-thickness keratoplasty. Penetrating keratoplasty (PK) may be preferred over DALK in cases of deep stromal scarring in which perforation is more likely to occur during deep lamellar resection.
- A lamellar graft can be performed for tectonic support as a primary procedure when ectasia occurs in the far periphery of the cornea and additional PK can be performed for visual rehabilitation.
### Follow-Up Evaluation
- Follow-up visits should include:
  - Interval history
  - Visual acuity
  - External examination
  - Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
  - Assessment of corneal contour and thickness by topography and tomography
- With the advent of CXL, more frequent follow-up (i.e., 3-6 months) for progression is now indicated. Younger patients may need to be followed even more frequently.
## Corneal Ectasia (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation) (continued)
### Patient Education
- Counsel all patients to avoid eye rubbing
- Discuss the benefits and potential risks of early crosslinking in patients at high risk for progression or who historically have noted progressive loss of vision
- Patients undergoing corneal transplantation should be made aware of the warning signs of rejection and should seek medical attention promptly if symptoms occur. The practitioner should be aware of the slit-lamp biomicroscopic findings of epithelial, stromal, and endothelial rejection.

## Corneal Edema and Opacification (Management Recommendations)
### Care Management
- Therapeutic goal is to control the cause of corneal edema or opacity and enhance a patient’s quality of life by improving visual acuity and comfort.
- In most cases, treatment starts with medical management; when this is insufficient, surgery may be considered.
#### Corneal Edema: Medical Management
- Lowering an elevated IOP is helpful.
- Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors should not be the first line of therapy when endothelial dysfunction is suspected.
- Topical corticosteroid can control inflammation once infection has been ruled out or controlled.
- Microcystic or bullous epithelial disease may produce discomfort or pain necessitating the placement of a bandage contact lens. Thin lenses with high water content and high oxygen diffusion coefficients may be safest.
- Supportive management should be initiated to reduce inflammation and/or pain in cases of acute hydrops.
#### Corneal Edema: Surgical Management
- Patients with corneal edema and persistent discomfort, but limited or no visual potential, are generally better candidates for the following procedures:
  - Conjunctival flap
  - Amniotic membrane tissue transplantation
  - A number of scarification procedures
- For patients with corneal edema and reduced vision or significant pain due to bullous keratopathy, a number of keratectomy and keratoplasty procedures can be considered.
#### Corneal Opacification: Medical Management
- Corneal opacity treatment can be divided into two phases:
  1. Management of the principal, initiating process (i.e., infection, trauma).
  2. Management of the resulting problems (i.e., surface erosions and irregularity, scarring, thinning, and vascularization).
- Conventional treatment involves an antibiotic drop or ointment to protect against secondary bacterial infection.
- Temporary tarsorrhaphy with botulinum toxin or suture can be helpful when blinking or eyelid closure is inadequate.
- A bandage contact lens or amniotic membrane may be helpful in cases of delayed healing.
- Pressure patching used to be standard treatment, but a study found that this does not positively impact comfort or speed of healing.
- Progressive thinning of cornea or a small perforation usually requires structural support with application of a tissue adhesive.
- Topical corticosteroids are often used to reduce intraocular and corneal inflammation. IOP and cataract formation should be monitored with long-term topical corticosteroid use.
- A rigid gas permeable lens — or hybrid or scleral lens when greater stability is needed — will often improve vision when surface irregularity is a factor; such lenses may obviate the need for more invasive procedures.
#### Corneal Opacification: Surgical Management
- Surgical strategy for managing corneal opacities depends on the tissue layer(s) involved:
  - Lamellar keratoplasty may be indicated for removal of deeper deposits.
  - Penetrating keratoplasty may be indicated for removal of even deeper multilevel opacities.
  - Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) may be used to remove calcific band keratopathy.
### Follow-Up Evaluation
- In the management of corneal edema, new or worse pain, redness, photophobia, and/or vision can herald disruption of the ocular surface, infection, inflammation, recurrence, or worsening that prompts immediate medical attention.
- In the management of corneal opacification, follow up to monitor corneal clarity and degree of surface irregularity is necessary.
- Coexisting problems, particularly intraocular inflammation and IOP, need regular reassessment.
### Patient Education
- Provide an understanding of balanced expectations of the amount of visual function that can realistically be preserved or recovered and risk of complications.
- Detailed discussion of the causes of edema or opacity, and various treatment options, is important.
- When the disease process or management is complex, every effort should be made to counsel the patient regarding such challenges to allow for appropriate expectations and informed decision-making.
## Dry Eye Syndrome (Initial Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History
- Ocular symptoms and signs (e.g., irritation, tearing, burning, stinging, dry or foreign body sensation, mild itching, photophobia, blurry vision, contact lens intolerance, redness, mucous discharge, increased frequency of blinking, eye fatigue, diurnal fluctuation, symptoms that worsen later in the day)
- Exacerbating conditions (e.g., air travel, decreased humidity, fans, prolonged visual efforts associated with decreased blink rate such as reading and digital devices, poorly fitted sleep apnea devices)
- Duration of symptoms
- Ocular history, including:
  - Topical medications and their associated preservatives (e.g., artificial tears, eyewash, antihistamines, glaucoma medications, vasoconstrictors, corticosteroids, antiviral medications, homeopathic or herbal preparations)
  - Contact lens history
  - Allergic conjunctivitis
  - Ocular surgical history (e.g., prior keratoplasty, cataract surgery, keratorefractive surgery)
  - Ocular surface disease (e.g., herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid, aniridia)

- Fluorescein tear break-up time
- Ocular surface dye staining (e.g., fluorescein, lissamine, rose bengal)
- Lacrimal gland function
- Tear Osmolarity
- Matrix metalloproteinase-9
### Care Management
- Treat any causative factors that are amenable to treatment as patients with dry eye symptoms often have many contributory factors
- Specific therapies may be chosen from any category (see Table) regardless of the level of disease severity, depending on physician experience and patient preference
### Follow-Up Evaluation
- Purpose is to assess response to therapy as a basis for altering or adjusting treatment as necessary, to monitor for ocular surface damage, and to provide reassurance
- Frequency and extent will depend on the severity of disease, therapeutic approach and response to therapy
### Patient Education
- Educate patients about the chronic nature of the disease and provide specific instructions for therapeutic regimens
- Periodically assess patient's compliance, understanding of the disease, benefits of treatment and potential complications, and re-inform patient as necessary
- Establish realistic expectations for effective management with patients
- Provide specific instructions for therapeutic regimens
- Reassess periodically the patient’s compliance and understanding of the disease, benefits of treatment and potential complications and re-inform as necessary
- Refer patients with manifestation of a systemic disease to an appropriate medical specialist
- Effective treatment for dry eye should be achieved before keratorefractive surgery. Uncontrolled dry eye syndrome is a contraindication for keratorefractive surgery.
## Staged Management and Treatment Recommendations for Dry Eye Syndrome
### Step 1
- Education on the condition, its management, treatment, and prognosis
- Modification of local environment
- Education regarding potential dietary modifications (including oral essential fatty acid supplementation)
- Identification and potential modification/elimination of offending systemic and topical medications
- Ocular lubricants of various types (if MGD is present, then consider lipid-containing supplements)
- Eyelid hygiene of various types and warm compresses
### Step 2
If the above options are inadequate, consider:
- Nonpreserved ocular lubricants to minimize preservative-induced toxicity
- Tea tree oil or lid-cleaner drop treatment for Demodex (if present), also off-label use of ivermectin 1% cream for Demodex
- Tear conservation
  - Punctal occlusion

  - Topical antibiotic or corticosteroid applied to the lid margins short-term for anterior blepharitis (if present)
  - Topical corticosteroid (limited duration)
  - Topical secretagogues
  - Topical nonglucocorticoid immunomodulatory drugs (such as cyclosporine)
  - Topical LFA-1 antagonist drugs (such as lifitegrast)
  - Topical water-free lipophilic liquid (perfluorohexyloctane)
  - Nasal spray (such as varenicline), cholinergic neuroactivation via the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway
  - Oral macrolide or tetracycline antibiotics
### Step 3
If the above options are inadequate, consider:
- Oral secretagogues
- Autologous/allogeneic serum eye drops
- Platelet-rich plasma eye drops
- Blood-based products
- Therapeutic contact lens options
  - Soft bandage lenses with caution
  - Rigid scleral lenses
### Step 4
If the above options are inadequate, consider:

## Amblyopia (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Demographic data, including sex, date of birth, and identity of parent/caregiver
- Identity of the historian and relationship to the patient, and any language barriers that may exist
- Identity of health care providers involved in the child’s care
- Chief complaint and reason for the eye evaluation
- Current eye problems
- Ocular history, including prior eye problems, diseases, diagnoses, and treatments
- Systemic history, birth weight, gestational age, prenatal and perinatal history that may be pertinent (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, and drug use during pregnancy), past hospitalizations and operations, and general health and development, including presence of developmental delay
- Current medications and allergies
- Family history of ocular conditions and relevant systemic diseases
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Binocular fixation test (Brückner test)
- Binocularity/stereoacuity testing
- Assessment of VA and/or fixation pattern
- Binocular alignment and ocular motility
- Pupillary exam
- External exam
- Anterior segment exam
- Cycloplegic retinoscopy/refraction with subjective refinement when indicated
- Funduscopic examination
### Care Management
- All children with amblyopia should be offered treatment regardless of age, including older children and teenagers, especially if not treated previously
- Prognosis for attaining normal vision depends upon age of onset, cause, severity, and duration of amblyopia, history of and response to previous treatment, adherence to treatment and concomitant conditions
- First goal is to correct any cause of visual deprivation; second goal is to correct refractive errors likely to cause blur; third is to promote use of the amblyopic eye, ultimately to achieve equal VA between the two eyes
- Choose treatment based on patient’s age, VA, adherence and response to previous treatment; and physical, social, and psychological status
- Once maximal VA has been obtained, treatment intensity can be tapered to maintenance therapy
- If VA in amblyopic eye is maintained as therapy is tapered, treatment may be stopped but with follow up planned because approximately one-fourth of children experience a recurrence within first year off treatment
### Follow-Up Evaluation
- Follow-up visits should include:
  - Determine VA of amblyopic eye
  - Interval history, including:
    - Adherence to treatment plan
    - Side effects of treatment
    - VA in the fellow eye
- Follow-up examination should be arranged 2 to 3 months after initiation of treatment
- Timing varies according to intensity of treatment and age of child
- Continued monitoring is necessary and additional treatment, if needed, is associated with long-term durability of the VA improvement
### Patient Education
- Discuss findings with the patients when appropriate and/or parent/caregivers to enhance understanding of diagnosis and rationale of treatment and to include them in a collaborative approach to therapy
- Formulate treatment plans in consultation with the patient and/or family/caregiver, and accounting for their perceptions of the existing alignment
- For patients for whom the potential for binocularity is poor, surgery to restore normal appearance may be an appropriate treatment
- Provide instructions on paper, reading materials, weblinks and video information to promote better understanding
## Esotropia (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Demographic data, including sex, date of birth, and identity of parent/caregiver
- Documentation of identity and relationship of historian
- Identity of other pertinent healthcare providers
- The chief complaint and reason for the eye evaluation, including date of onset and frequency of the ocular misalignment; which eye is deviated and in what direction; and the presence or absence of diplopia, squinting, closing one eye, or other visual symptoms. Review of photographs and/or videos of the patient may be helpful.
- Ocular history, including other eye problems, injuries, diseases, surgery, and treatments (including eyeglasses and/or amblyopia therapy)
- Systemic history, birth weight, gestational age, pertinent prenatal and perinatal history (e.g., alcohol, drug, and tobacco use during pregnancy), past hospitalizations and operations, and general health and development
- Family history, including eye conditions (strabismus, amblyopia, type of eyeglasses and history of wear, extraocular muscle surgery, or other eye surgery, and genetic diseases)
- Social history (e.g., grade level in school, learning difficulties, behavior problems, or issues with social interactions)
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity and verification of eyeglass prescription with a lensometer
- Binocular alignment at distance and near in primary gaze, up and down gaze, and horizontal gaze positions, if possible. If eyeglasses are worn, alignment testing should be performed with correction; alignment testing without correction may also be appropriate in some circumstances.
- Extraocular muscle function (ductions and versions, including incommittance such as found in some A and V patterns)
- General facial examination to note any pronounced dysmorphology or asymmetry
- Detection of latent or manifest nystagmus
- Assessment of head posture
- Sensory testing, including fusion and stereoacuity
- Cycloplegic retinoscopy/refraction
- Fundoscopic examination
### Care Management
- Consider all forms of esotropia for treatment and re-establish binocular alignment as soon as possible
- Significant refractive errors should be corrected
- If eyeglasses and amblyopia management are ineffective in aligning the eyes, then surgical correction is indicated
- Amblyopia treatment is usually started before surgery because it may alter the angle of strabismus and/or increase the likelihood of good postoperative binocularity
### Follow-Up Evaluation
- Periodic evaluations necessary because of high risk of developing amblyopia, losing binocular vision, and having a recurrence of strabismus
- Children who are well-aligned and do not have amblyopia may be followed up every 6 to 12 months
- Frequency of follow-up visits can be reduced as the child matures
- New or changing findings may indicate need for more frequent follow-up examinations
- Detection of uncorrected or undercorrected hyperopia is essential in the child with a recurrence of esotropia after successful initial treatment
- Repeat cycloplegic refraction should be performed before concluding that the esotropia has a nonaccommodative component
### Patient Education
- Discuss findings with the patient when appropriate and/or parents/caregivers to enhance understanding of diagnosis and rationale of treatment and to include them in a collaborative approach to therapy
- Formulate treatment plans in consultation with the patient and/or family/caregivers, responsive to the preferences and expectations of the parent/caregiver and patient, and accounting for their perceptions of the existing alignment
- For patients for whom the potential for binocularity is poor, surgery to restore normal appearance may be an appropriate treatment
## Exotropia (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Demographic data, including sex, date of birth, and identity of parent/caregiver
- Documentation of identity and relationship of historian
- Identity of other pertinent health care providers
- The chief complaint and reason for the eye evaluation, including date of onset and frequency of the ocular misalignment; which eye is deviated and in what direction; and the presence or absence of diplopia, squinting, closing one eye, or other visual symptoms. Review of photographs and/or videos of the patient may be helpful.
- Ocular history, including other eye problems, injuries, diseases, surgery, and treatments (including eyeglasses and/or amblyopia therapy)
- Systemic history, birth weight, gestational age, pertinent prenatal and perinatal history (e.g., alcohol, drug, and tobacco use during pregnancy), past hospitalizations and operations, and general health and development
- Family history, including eye conditions (strabismus, amblyopia, type of eyeglasses and history of wear, extraocular muscle surgery), other eye surgery, and genetic diseases
- Social history (e.g., grade level in school, learning difficulties, behavior problems, or issues with social interactions)
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity and verification of eyeglass prescription with a lensometer
- Binocular alignment at distance and near in primary gaze, up and down gaze, and horizontal gaze positions, if possible. If eyeglasses are worn, alignment testing should be performed with correction; alignment testing without correction may also be appropriate in some circumstances.
- Extraocular muscle function (ductions and versions), including incomitance such as found in some A and V patterns
- General facial examination to note any pronounced dysmorphology or asymmetry
- Detection of latent or manifest nystagmus
- Assessment of head posture
- Sensory testing, including fusion and stereoacuity
- Cycloplegic retinoscopy/refraction
- Funduscopic examination
- Assessment of the fusional control of the exodeviation at both distance and near fixation
- Prism and alternate cover test measures total deviation, and as such, used to quantify the amount of surgery, if required
### Care Management
- All forms of exotropia should be monitored and some require treatment
- Young children with intermittent exotropia and good fusional control should be followed without surgery
- Deviations that are present most or all of the time often require treatment
- Prescribe corrective lenses for any clinically significant refractive error causing reduced vision in one or both eyes
- Optimal therapy for exotropia, the long-term benefit of early surgical correction, and the relative merits of bilateral versus unilateral surgery are not well established
- Amblyopia is uncommon in patients with intermittent exotropia, but, if present, should be treated
### Follow-up Evaluation
- Periodic evaluations necessary because of high risk of developing amblyopia, losing binocular vision, and having a recurrence of strabismus
- Children who are well-aligned and do not have amblyopia may be followed up every 6 to 12 months
- By age 7 to 10 years, the frequency of exams may be reduced
- New or changing findings may indicate need for more frequent follow-up examinations
- Includes frequency of any deviation, adherence to treatment (if any), assessment of ocular motility and update of refractive correction, if needed
### Patient Education
- Discuss findings with the patient when appropriate and/or parents/caregivers to enhance understanding of disorder and recruit them in a collaborative approach to therapy
- Formulate treatment plans in consultation with the patient and/or family/caregivers, responsive to the preferences and expectations of the parent/caregiver and patient, and accounting for their perceptions of the existing alignment
- For patients for whom the potential for binocularity is poor, surgery to restore normal appearance may be an appropriate treatment
## Keratorefractive Surgery (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History
- Present status of visual function
- Refractive error progression
- Prior correction, including contact lens wear
- Ocular history
- Systemic history
- Medications
### Initial Physical Exam
- Distance and near visual acuity for each eye separately, with and without correction
- Cycloplegic refraction if accommodation cannot be relaxed, symptoms are not consistent with manifest refractive error and when accuracy of refraction is in question
- Computerized corneal topography/tomography
- Central corneal thickness measurement
- Evaluation of tear film and ocular surface
- Evaluation of ocular motility and alignment
### Care Management
- Discontinue contact lenses before preoperative exam and procedure
- Inform patient of the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to and among the different refractive procedures
- Document informed consent process; patient should be given an opportunity to have all questions answered before surgery, including costs
- Formulate a postoperative care plan and inform the patient of these arrangements
- Check and calibrate all instrumentation before the procedure
### Postoperative Care
- Operating surgeon is responsible for the preoperative assessment and postoperative management
- For surface ablation techniques, examination on the day following surgery is advisable and every several days thereafter until the epithelium is healed
- For uncomplicated LASIK, examine within 36 hours following surgery, a second visit 1 to 4 weeks postoperatively, and further visits thereafter as appropriate
### Patient Education
Discuss the risks and benefits of the planned procedure with the patient. Elements of the discussion include the following:
- Range of expected refractive outcomes
- Residual refractive error
- Reading and/or distance correction postoperatively
- Loss of or change to uncorrected habitual near visual function
- Monovision advantages and disadvantages (for patients of presbyopic age)
- Loss of best-corrected visual acuity
- Side effects and complications (e.g., microbial keratitis, sterile keratitis, keratectasia)
- Changes in visual function not necessarily measured by visual acuity testing, including glare and function under low-light conditions
- Night vision symptoms (e.g., glare, haloes) developing or worsening; careful consideration should be given to this issue for patients with high degrees of ametropia or for individuals who require a high level of visual function in low-light conditions
- Effect on ocular alignment
- Development or exacerbation of dry eye symptoms
- Recurrent erosion syndrome
- Advantages and disadvantages of same-day bilateral keratorefractive surgery versus sequential surgery. Because vision might be poor for some time after bilateral same-day photorefractive keratectomy, the patient should be informed that activities such as driving might not be possible for weeks.
- Possibility that it may influence predictive accuracy of IOL calculations for subsequent cataract surgery
## Adult Strabismus with a History of Childhood Strabismus
### Initial Exam History
- Ocular misalignment
- Strabismus angle and direction
- History of chronicity, review past clinical, surgical, and imaging records
- Neuro-ophthalmic evaluation in cases where presentation suggests neurologic or systemic disease
### Initial Physical Exam
- Optical correction (glasses) and presence of any ground-in or overlay prism, and impact that the current correction might have on alignment
- Dry manifest and cycloplegic refraction providing clues to original oculomotor disturbance
- Complete motility examination, including cover-uncover, alternate-cover testing, prism and alternate cover measurements, and testing for binocular fusion and stereopsis, and assessment of alignment by light reflex testing (e.g., Krimsky) to compare with cover test and identification of abnormal angle kappa
- Strabismus patterns suggestive of central nervous system, orbital or thyroid conditions
- Inspection of the ocular surface for conjunctival scars (prior incision sites) and exposure of the thinned sclera behind anatomical insertions (evidence of likely muscle recession)
- Inspection of the interpalpebral fissures for evidence of prior vertical or horizontal rectus muscle resection (smaller interpalpebral fissure) or recession (larger interpalpebral fissure)
- Prism testing to simulate desired postsurgical alignment and range of overcorrection and undercorrection comfortably tolerated and unlikely to result in diplopia
- Assessment for ocular torsion by sensory testing or anatomic evidence of torsion noted during indirect ophthalmoscopy, particularly in patients with vertical strabismus
- Imaging (e.g., CT, MRI, ultrasound or OCT) although nearly all cases can be managed without imaging
### Management Plan
- Patient should be monitored/observed if symptoms are mild, occasional, and well tolerated or if patient is opposed to treatment
- Consider if alignment might be improved with changing optical correction (e.g., correction of hyperopia and appropriate bifocal or progressive lenses for adults approaching presbyopia)
- Reversal of monovision may be necessary and may resolve symptoms
- Prisms to address some forms of diplopia, and orthoptic exercises to address some forms of diplopia and asthenopia can be considered
### Surgical and Postoperative Care
- Correction of childhood strabismus in adults is generally surgical but, because a broad range of conditions may be responsible, specifics of surgery will vary
- Sequelae of previous surgery (undercorrection of recessed muscle, restriction of a scarred muscle, or unsightly surgical scarring) should be addressed to optimize postoperative alignment
### Patient Education and Follow-up
- Patients and caregivers should be informed about the findings, disorder, and management options, as well as the adaptation to the new ocular alignment resulting from surgery
\* Please refer to the Adult Strabismus Preferred Practice Patterns for care process of other forms of adult strabismus
