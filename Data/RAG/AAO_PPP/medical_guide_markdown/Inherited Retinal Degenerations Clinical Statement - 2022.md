## CLINICAL STATEMENT
Guidelines on Clinical Assessment of Patients with Inherited Retinal Degenerations
### Abstract
This Academy Clinical Statement provides recommendations and clinical genetic assessments of patients with inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs). Various testing procedures and the timing at which they are recommended are described for patients within 4 broad classes of IRD (rod-cone degenerations, cone-rod degenerations, chorioretinal degenerations, and inherited macular dystrophies). Pediatric patients not infrequently require modified testing regimens or sedation for accurate assessment. Genetic testing and genetic counseling are essential components of the management of patients with IRDs as genetic testing may confirm the diagnosis, provide information to optimize management of the patient and family members, and potentially confirm eligibility to participate in clinical trials. For example, genetic testing is required to determine eligibility of patients for approved gene therapies such as voretigene neparvovec-rzyl for RPE65-related IRD. This document is intended to provide guidelines for the management of patients with IRDs and provides information to support and educate patients with IRD. As always, final decisions are the responsibility of the individual treating physicians and are based on the needs of individual patients.
### Introduction
Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) comprise a wide range of genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous diseases that share a variable progressive loss of photoreceptor function accompanied by visual loss. Understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IRDs has expanded dramatically, leading to clinical trials of therapies to slow photoreceptor degeneration or restore some vision. Treatments target specific genetic causes of disease and stages of the degenerative process. In some cases, treatments target disease genes or mutations. The FDA (in 2017), the EMA (in 2018), and Health Canada and the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia (2020) approved voretigene neparvovec-rzyl for RPE65-related IRD to specifically treat patients in countries where it is approved. Clinical care of patients has evolved over the past decade with improved diagnostic tools (e.g., genetic testing, novel noninvasive visual function testing, and imaging studies). These guidelines highlight the benefit of recent advances for both practitioners and patients and will help develop standards for best use of new technologies with the goal of helping physicians optimize patient care.
### Examinations for Patients with Inherited Retinal Degenerations
Patient evaluations aim to:
1. Establish a clinical diagnosis so the patient receives appropriate care (prognosis, monitoring for co-morbidities, and assessment of other organs that may be affected in syndromic conditions). Other non-genetic causes of retinal degeneration should be considered and excluded.
2. Provide information on the genetic nature and inheritance of the disease and communicate the implications to other relevant family members.
3. Provide information about ongoing or future clinical trials and novel treatments.
4. Help the patient and family cope with and prepare for progressive visual impairment (low vision consultation, employment accommodations, and emotional support).
### What should be done
## Clinical Evaluation and Diagnostic Tools for Eye Disease
- A thorough ocular/medical history and pedigree documenting family history of eye disease should be obtained at the initial visit and updated during subsequent visits.
- Understanding the patient’s mood and affect is important, being sensitive to signs of depression that may accompany progressive vision loss.
- **Molecular genetic testing (genotyping)** of the patient can be valuable to confirm the diagnosis and optimize management.
- **Clinical evaluation:**
  - Best-corrected visual acuity with manifest refraction using standardized eye charts.
  - Biomicroscopy with measurement of intraocular pressure (assessment of cataracts and anterior segment anomalies).
  - Dilated ophthalmoscopy to document features potentially related to vision loss (optic nerve and other retinal diseases, deposits, vessels, atrophy, schisis, and macular edema).
### Imaging
- **Standard color or wide-field fundus photography** may be performed at the initial visit to provide documentation of disease state and provide the context to align and compare data from other fundus modalities such as fundus autofluorescence (AF) images.
  - For patients with nyctalopia and/or peripheral visual field loss, wide-field imaging has advantages since the primary site of disease is not in the macula in early disease.
  - Fundus photos should be used sparingly in Stargardt disease and other maculopathies due to the risk of light toxicity. A test should be ordered only if it will be useful to monitor disease progress or determine if a patient is eligible for a clinical trial.
  - Macular or wide-field AF fundus imaging using reduced illumination (25%), longer exciting wavelengths, infrared AF or near infrared fundus reflectance are good alternatives to short-wavelength AF in patients with retinitis pigmentosa and Stargardt disease to possibly reduce the risk of phototoxicity, although near-infrared imaging provides distinct information.
    - **Near infrared fundus reflectance** is a separate imaging modality from short-wavelength AF that also provides insight on RPE health.
- **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)** provides cross-sectional imaging of the photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium, and inner retinal layers including the retinal nerve fiber layer.
  - High-density volume scans with documentation of central retinal thickness provide a useful baseline for monitoring progression in structural features and helping to monitor CME, epiretinal membranes, or macular schisis.
### Visual Field Testing
- **Visual field testing** is important to document the functional extent of vision from central to the far periphery. This is essential for determination of legal blindness, disability, and to counsel patients on visual limitations.
  - **Static visual field testing** has advantages of automated indices of sensitivity loss and performance parameters to assess reliability.
    - Newer perimeters test the entire field, and digital data can be exported into other applications for specific purposes such as modeling of sensitivity, which is useful for quantitative measurement in clinical trials.
    - Although static perimetry using the Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) 30-2 protocol is acceptable in the federal registry for the determination of
## Clinical Evaluation: Inherited Retinal Degenerative Diseases
- **Legal blindness and vision-related disability:** There are perimeters that allow static testing well beyond the 60-degree range.
  - This document does not advocate for any specific company's instrument or product.
- **Kinetic perimetry:** The most common method used to assess peripheral vision and for licensing requirements for driving, disability evaluations, and legal blindness status.
- **Fundus-guided perimeters (microperimeters):** Particularly useful for measuring macular function in patients with eccentric fixation due to maculopathy and to investigate structure-function correlations.
### Electrophysiology
- **Full-field electroretinogram (ERG):**
  Important for diagnosis and staging of diffuse photoreceptor disease, evaluating the retina-wide function of rods and cones.
  - Delays in cone b-wave implicit times are an early sign of disease and reflect retina-wide involvement.
  - Young patients with disease that appears to be limited to the macula benefit from full-field ERGs to rule out retina-wide disease.
- **Multifocal or pattern ERG testing:**
  Useful for detection and monitoring disease progression for diseases that primarily affect the macula.
  - However, its accuracy can be limited in those patients with notable loss of central vision who are unable to maintain steady fixation.
- **ISCEV (International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision):**
  Published and updated standards that enable recordings to be compared between institutions and examiners ([link to article](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10633-014-9473-7)).
- **Full-field stimulus test (FST):**
  Although not a test that uses electrophysiology, FST can be useful when retinal function can no longer be reliably documented by ERG. It provides a test that can measure rod- and cone-mediated visual function but does not require stable fixation or electrode contact with the eye.
Because IRDs comprise a variety of conditions, different examinations may be applied to patients with different types of disease. Four major types of IRDs that are encountered clinically include rod-cone degenerations, cone-rod degenerations, chorioretinal degenerations, and inherited macular dystrophies. The table presented below describes the examinations and timing at which the tests should be considered for patients with IRDs. For syndromic diseases such as Usher syndrome, the schedule should include additional referral of the patient to an otolaryngologist or audiologist at baseline and for continued management of any audiologic and balance issues. Other syndromic retinal degenerations may need referral to a wider group of physicians for follow-up of systemic disease.

## Pediatric Patients
Young children are often not able to perform the functional tests utilized in adults or may provide data that are unreliable. It is difficult to measure visual function in infants (preferential looking, optokinetic nystagmus, pupilometry, etc.). With infants under 2 years of age, certain tests such as full-field ERG using skin electrodes or hand-held OCT imaging can be performed after swaddling the sleepy infant in the dark, but most often sedation provides more reliable results. Sedated exams between the ages of 2 and 6 also provide the opportunity for a more comprehensive exam and higher quality imaging; however, the risks of sedation must be weighed against the value of the information gained at the specific age. In some cases, sedation may influence ERG tracings, so normative data are essential for proper interpretation. Visual field measurement in children less than 7 years old can be challenging and unreliable; however, with repetition, performance will often improve as the child matures.
## Genetic Testing and Genetic Counseling
Methods for identifying the genetic cause of IRDs have advanced significantly in recent years, such that a causative mutation can be identified in up to 56-76% of patients with inherited retinal disorders. Genetic testing is appropriate for most patients with a presumed genetic retinal degeneration. At-risk family members can sometimes benefit from genetic testing, although the implications of genetic testing for asymptomatic individuals in the absence of established therapies must be considered and should be accompanied by genetic counseling. The American Academy of Ophthalmology Task Force on Genetic Testing published recommendations for genetic testing of inherited eye diseases located at [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/229244025](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/229244025). A negative result does not necessarily mean the patient does not have the disease. Absence of a disease variant may be affected by the testing methodology.
Genetic testing that clearly identifies the genetic cause of disease does not need to be repeated but testing which was negative or inconclusive upon original testing may be revisited. The identification of new IRD genes and advances in laboratory technology can improve the detection rate. Moreover, as our interpretation of variants improves, a result that was considered to be inconclusive may yield a positive result with improved interpretation of variants.
Genetic testing plays an important role in improving the accuracy of diagnosis and prognosis, providing patients and families with specific inheritance risks, and guiding treatment decisions. For example, patients would need to have genetic testing to determine if they are eligible for FDA-approved voretigene neparvovec or be considered for any of the numerous clinical trials of gene-based therapies (clinicaltrials.gov). Genetic testing can identify patients with retinal disease due to mutations in genes with systemic associations. Genetic testing for patients with IRDs can take multiple forms, including single gene analyses.
## Patient Education and Support
Through discussions with their eye care team, patients should be provided with information about the hereditary and likely progressive course of disease along with counseling about genetic testing and diagnoses, as described above. Physicians play an important role in encouraging low vision rehabilitation, working with school personnel, advocating for mobility training, and assessing emotional status. Patients may benefit from low vision evaluation at baseline and every 1-2 years as necessary. Patients should also be informed of registries and information about research in the field, including clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

These websites should be of value for contacting rehabilitation services for patients with blinding retinal diseases.
Every state has a department of rehabilitation supported by the National Council of State Agencies for the Blind. Support services include vocational rehabilitation (including job retraining), mobility training, evaluation for assistive technology devices, and individualized counseling. Local support services can be found at [www.ncsab.org](https://www.ncsab.org). Many low vision patients may benefit from use of a guide dog; information on guide dog services in the United States can be found at [https://www.guidedogs.com](https://www.guidedogs.com). Physicians should also be aware of the necessity of supporting the mental health needs of their patients, both at the onset of the diagnosis and as the condition progresses. This support may come from resources such as low vision support groups and individual counseling services.22
## Summary
## Patients with Inherited Retinal Degenerations
Patients with inherited retinal degenerations will benefit from evolving knowledge that may influence their outcome. Special attention to aspects of the history and ophthalmic examination, tests of retinal structure and function, and genetic testing all help to determine an accurate diagnosis. Clinical and genetic testing of patients with IRDs go hand in hand, and one should not be interpreted without the other to ensure accuracy. This Clinical Statement aims to guide Academy members and care providers to optimize evaluations at baseline and during ongoing care of patients with IRDs.
