## Information Statement on the Safety of Pharmacologic Mydriasis for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening
While the gold standard for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening is a dilated funduscopic examination by an ophthalmologist, alternative methods such as telemedicine-based programs and artificial intelligence (AI)-based programs have allowed the expansion of DR screening programs to primary care and rural settings.¹ Telemedicine and AI screening involves color fundus photography. The images are interpreted by clinicians or trained readers, in the case of telemedicine, or at the point of care by a United States Food and Drug Administration-approved AI system.
The diagnostic yield of color fundus photography-based DR screening is greatly improved with the use of pharmacologic mydriasis. For example, in a DR screening study, the use of tropicamide 1% reduced the proportion of ungradable images from 26% to 5%.² However, primary care clinicians' fear of the risk of acute angle closure may limit the use of pharmacologic dilation and thus limit the yield of screening examinations.
The actual risk of acute angle-closure glaucoma after pharmacologic pupillary dilation is very low. Among more than 4800 participants in the cross-sectional Baltimore Eye Study who were dilated with tropicamide 1% and phenylephrine 2.5%, there were no reported cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma.³ Thirty-eight participants who were referred for a definitive eye examination were judged by an ophthalmologist to have anterior eye anatomy at risk for angle closure ("occludable angles").³ Of these, 28 participants were dilated with tropicamide 0.5%, and none developed acute angle-closure glaucoma.³ The remaining 10 participants underwent laser peripheral iridotomy surgery (LPI) prior to dilation, but it is unknown whether they would have developed acute angle-closure glaucoma without this procedure.³ The combination of a shallow anterior chamber by penlight examination and a history of glaucoma were the most effective combination of risk factors for predicting a potentially occludable angle.³
In a systematic review of approximately 600,000 people who underwent pharmacologic mydriasis for screening eye examinations, acute angle-closure glaucoma occurred in 33 individuals (0.006%), all of whom had received long-acting (atropine or homatropine) or combination (phenylephrine plus tropicamide) dilating agents.⁴ Among nearly 4000 patients who received tropicamide only, there were no cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma.⁴ In addition, there were no documented cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma among more than 1000 dilated patients with a history of chronic open-angle glaucoma.⁴
Similarly, in a retrospective review of more than 95,000 patients in the Northern Ireland Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program, there were only 3 reported cases of angle closure among individuals who underwent dilation with tropicamide 1%.⁵ The overall risk of angle closure was 1 in 31,755 patients, with an annual incidence of 0.75 cases per year.⁵ For comparison, the overall annual risk of acute angle-closure glaucoma in the general population without dilation has been estimated at 2.2 to 4.1 cases per 100,000 in European populations and 12.2 per 100,000 in Singapore.⁶⁻⁹
Even among populations at greater risk for angle closure such as Asian individuals, the risk of acute angle-closure glaucoma after pharmacologic dilation is very low.¹⁰ For example, a randomized study...
## Controlled Trial and Pharmacologic Dilation
A controlled trial in China studied the risk of acute angle-closure attacks after pharmacologic dilation in nearly 900 individuals who had been diagnosed as bilateral primary angle-closure suspect. Participants received LPI in one eye and no treatment in the other, and both eyes were dilated 6 times with phenylephrine 5% and tropicamide 0.5% over 72 months of follow-up. Over this time period, there were only 2 cases of post-dilation acute angle-closure attacks in eyes that did not receive LPI. The overall risk of acute angle-closure attack in untreated eyes was 1 in 1587 dilations (0.063%).
Similarly, in a cross-sectional study in China of patients with diabetes mellitus dilated with phenylephrine 0.5% and tropicamide 0.5%, only one of nearly 2300 patients developed acute angle closure. In another observational case series in more than 1900 patients with diabetes in China, dilation with either phenylephrine 2.5% plus tropicamide 1% or tropicamide 1% alone resulted in no cases of acute angle closure.
Taken as a whole, the above data support that pharmacologic dilation with tropicamide 1% is safe, and the risk of acute angle-closure glaucoma is very low. Therefore, routine dilation with tropicamide can be implemented in DR screening programs to improve the diagnostic yield of fundus photography. However, primary care settings should also have ophthalmologist referral networks available in case of rare adverse events with dilation. Symptoms of acute angle closure can include unilateral or bilateral eye pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and seeing halos around lights. In the event that these symptoms develop within hours after pharmacologic pupillary dilation, referral to an ophthalmologist or an emergency physician is warranted.
