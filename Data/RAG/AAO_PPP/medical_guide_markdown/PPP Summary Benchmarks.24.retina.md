## SUMMARY BENCHMARKS FOR PREFERRED PRACTICE PATTERN GUIDELINES
### Introduction
These are summary benchmarks for the Academy’s Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines. The Preferred Practice Pattern series of guidelines has been written on the basis of three principles.
- Each Preferred Practice Pattern should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful information to practitioners.
- Each recommendation that is made should be given an explicit rating that shows its importance to the care process.
- Each recommendation should also be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence that supports the recommendation and reflects the best evidence available.
### Preferred Practice Patterns Provide Guidance
Preferred Practice Patterns provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular individual. While they should generally meet the needs of most patients, they cannot possibly best meet the needs of all patients. Adherence to these Preferred Practice Patterns will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation. These practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results. It may be necessary to approach different patients’ needs in different ways. The physician must make the ultimate judgment about the propriety of the care of a particular patient in light of all of the circumstances presented by that patient. The American Academy of Ophthalmology is available to assist members in resolving ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of ophthalmic practice.
**The Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual situations.** The Academy specifically disclaims any and all liability for injury or other damages of any kind, from negligence or otherwise, for any and all claims that may arise out of the use of any recommendations or other information contained herein.
### Overview of Recommendations
For each major disease condition, recommendations for the process of care, including the history, physical exam and ancillary tests, are summarized, along with major recommendations for the care management, follow-up, and education of the patient. For each PPP, a detailed literature search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library for articles in the English language is conducted. The results are reviewed by an expert panel and used to prepare the recommendations, which are then given a rating that shows the strength of evidence when sufficient evidence exists.
To rate individual studies, a scale based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) is used. The definitions and levels of evidence to rate individual studies are as follows:
- **I++**: High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias
- **I+**: Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias
- **I-**: Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias
- **II++**: High-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies; high-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal
- **II+**: Well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal
- **II-**: Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal
- **III**: Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series)
## SUMMARY BENCHMARKS FOR PREFERRED PRACTICE PATTERN GUIDELINES
### Introduction (continued)
Recommendations for care are formed based on the body of the evidence. The body of evidence quality ratings are defined by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) as follows:
- **Good quality (GQ):** Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
- **Moderate quality (MQ):** Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
- **Insufficient quality (IQ):** Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; any estimate of effect is very uncertain.
Key recommendations for care are defined by GRADE as follows:
- **Strong recommendation (SR):** Used when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects or clearly do not.
- **Discretionary recommendation (DR):** Used when the trade-offs are less certain—either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced.
The PPPs are intended to serve as guides in patient care, with greatest emphasis on technical aspects. In applying this knowledge, it is essential to recognize that true medical excellence is achieved only when skills are applied in such a manner that the patients’ needs are the foremost consideration. The Academy is available to assist members in resolving ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of practice. (Academy Code of Ethics)
## Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Symptoms (metamorphopsia, decreased vision, scotoma, photopsia, difficulties in dark adaptation)
- Medications and nutritional supplement use
- Ocular history
- Medical history (any hypersensitivity reactions)
- Family history, especially family history of AMD
- Social history, especially quantitative smoking history
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Comprehensive eye examination
- Amsler grid
- Stereoscopic biomicroscopic examination of the macula
### Diagnostic Tests
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is important in diagnosing and managing AMD, particularly with respect to determining the presence of subretinal and intraretinal fluid and in documenting the degree of retinal thickening. Optical coherence tomography defines the cross-sectional architecture of the retina, which is not possible with other imaging technology. It may reveal the presence of fluid that is not apparent on biomicroscopy alone. It also assists in evaluating the response of the retina and RPE to therapy by allowing structural changes to be followed accurately. Newer generation OCT modalities, including SD-OCT and SS-OCT, are preferred technologies.
Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) provides noninvasive evaluation of the retinal and choroidal vasculature and is being more commonly applied in the evaluation and management of AMD, but it has not replaced other angiographic methods.
Intravenous fundus fluorescein angiography is indicated:
- when patient complains of new metamorphopsia
- when patient has unexplained blurred vision
- when clinical exam reveals elevation of the RPE or retina, macular edema, subretinal blood, hard exudates or subretinal fibrosis or the OCT shows evidence of fluid
- to detect the presence of and determine the extent, type, size, and location of MNV
- to guide treatment (laser photocoagulation surgery or verteporfin PDT)
- to detect persistent or recurrent MNV or other retinal diseases following treatment
- to assist in determining the cause of visual loss that is not explained by clinical exam
Each angiographic facility should have a care plan for an emergency and a clear protocol to minimize the risks and to manage complications.
### Follow-up Exam History
- Visual symptoms, including decreased vision and metamorphopsia
- Changes in medications and nutritional supplements
- Changes in ocular history and medical history
- Changes in social history, especially smoking
### Follow-up Physical Exam
- Visual acuity at distance with correction
- Amsler grid
- Stereoscopic biomicroscopic examination of the fundus
### Follow-up after Treatment for Neovascular AMD
- Examine patients treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy approximately at 4-week intervals
- Subsequent examinations, OCT, OCTA, and fluorescein angiography should be performed as indicated depending on the clinical findings and the judgment of the treating ophthalmologist
### Patient Education
- Educate patients about the prognosis and potential value of treatment as appropriate for their visual and functional status
- Encourage patients with early AMD or a family history of AMD to assess their own visual acuity using monocular vision testing and to have regular dilated eye exams for early detection of intermediate AMD
- Educate patients with a high-risk AMD phenotype about methods of detecting new symptoms of MNV and about the need for prompt notification to an ophthalmologist
- Instruct patients with unilateral disease to monitor their vision in their fellow eye and to return periodically even in absence of symptoms, but promptly after onset of new or significant visual symptoms
- Instruct patients to report symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, including eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, increased sensitivity to light, or increased number of floaters promptly
- Strongly recommend to patients who are currently smoking to stop because there are observational data that support a causal relationship between smoking and AMD and other considerable health benefits of smoking cessation
## Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Management Recommendations)
- Inform patients who have been instructed by their physician that long-term aspirin is appropriate and beneficial to continue with aspirin therapy as prescribed.
- Refer patients with reduced visual function for vision rehabilitation (see [www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab)) and social services.
#### TABLE 5
**Risk for Progression of Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Treatments by Severity Level**
| Stage of AMD                                  | Risk of Progression to Advanced AMD (approximately)* | Treatment Options                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| No drusen (AREDS category 1)                  | 5-year risk 0.5%, 10-year risk 1.5%                 | None                                                |
| Early AMD (AREDS category 2)                  | 5-year risk 4%, 10-year risk 8%                     | None                                                |
| Intermediate AMD (AREDS category 3) Without pigment OU | 5-year risk 9%, 10-year risk 28%                   | AREDS2 antioxidant supplements**                   |
| Advanced AMD – GA (AREDS category 4)          | 5-year risk 45%, 10-year risk 71%                   | Consider intravitreal medication                    |
| Advanced AMD – MNV (AREDS category 4)         | 5-year risk 45%, 10-year risk 71%                   | Anti-VEGF intravitreal injections may be recommended |
| Extrafoveal Choroidal Neovascularization in AMD (AREDS category 4) | 5-year risk 45%, 10-year risk 71%                   | Anti-VEGF intravitreal injections or laser surgery may be recommended |
AMD = Age-Related Macular Degeneration; Anti-VEGF = Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor; GA = geographic atrophy; MNV = macular neovascularization.
*The risk of progression to advanced AMD is based on the simplified severity scale and based on the AREDS cohort aged 55 to 80 years of age.
**The AREDS design included participants ages 55–80 years old.
## Diabetic Retinopathy (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Duration of diabetes
- Past glycemic control (HbA1c)
- Medications
- Medical history (e.g., obesity, renal disease, systemic hypertension, serum lipid levels, pregnancy, neuropathy, cystic fibrosis)
- Ocular history (e.g., trauma, other eye diseases, ocular injections, surgery, including retinal laser surgery)
### Initial Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- Measurement of IOP
- Gonioscopy before dilation when indicated (for neovascularization of the iris or increased IOP)
- Pupillary assessment for optic nerve dysfunction
- Thorough fundoscopy including stereoscopic examination of the posterior pole
- Examination of the peripheral retina and vitreous, best performed with indirect ophthalmoscopy or with slit-lamp biomicroscopy
### Diagnosis
- Classify both eyes as to category and severity of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. Each category has an inherent risk for progression and is dependent on adherence to overall diabetes control.
### Follow-up History
- Visual symptoms
- Systemic status (pregnancy, blood pressure, serum lipids, renal status)
- Glycemic status (HbA1c)
- Other treatments (dialysis, fenofibrates)
### Follow-up Physical Exam
- Visual acuity
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with iris examination
- Measurement of IOP
- Gonioscopy (preferably before dilation when iris neovascularization is suspected or if IOP is elevated)
- Stereoscopic examination of the posterior pole after dilation of the pupils
- Examination of the peripheral retina and vitreous when indicated
- OCT imaging when appropriate
### Ancillary Tests
- **Color fundus photography** may be useful for documenting the severity of the diabetes, the presence of NVE and NVD, the response to treatment, and the need for additional treatment at future visits. Widefield imaging can be helpful in documenting overall DR burden.
- **Optical coherence tomography** can be used to quantify retinal thickness, monitor macular edema, identify vitreomacular traction, and detect other forms of macular disease in patients with diabetic macular edema. Decisions to treat with anti-VEGF injections, change therapeutic agents (e.g., use of intraocular corticosteroids), initiate laser surgery treatment, or even consider vitrectomy surgery are often based in part on OCT findings.
- **Fluorescein angiography** is not indicated as a part of the regular examination of patients with diabetes. Use of focal laser surgery has decreased. FA is useful to differentiate DME from other macular disease or for patients with unexplained vision loss. Angiography can identify macular capillary nonperfusion as an explanation for vision loss that is unresponsive to therapy and may detect areas of untreated retinal capillary nonperfusion that explain persistent retinal or disc neovascularization after previous scatter laser surgery.
- **Optical coherence tomography angiography** offers a noninvasive nature and the ability to visualize depth-resolved, capillary-level abnormalities in the three retinal plexuses, offering a much more quantitative assessment of macular ischemia. Although the technology is FDA approved, the guidelines and indications for use in diabetic retinopathy are evolving.
- **Ultrasonography** enables assessment of the status of the retina in the presence of a vitreous hemorrhage or other media opacity, and may be helpful to define the amount of vitreous hemorrhage, the extent and severity of vitreoretinal traction, and diagnose diabetic retinal detachments in the setting of media opacity.
- **Other tests** may include electroretinography (to evaluate neural dysfunction of the retina) and visual field testing (to detect retinal dysfunction). Artificial intelligence is being evaluated as an adjunct to monitor and predict disease progression.
## Diabetic Retinopathy (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation) (continued)
### Patient Education
- Discuss results of exam and implications
- Encourage patients with diabetes but without diabetic retinopathy to have annual dilated eye exams
- Inform patients that effective treatment for diabetic retinopathy depends on timely intervention, despite good vision and no ocular symptoms, and that current treatments often require multiple visits and evaluations over time for adequate delivery of therapeutic effect
- Educate patients about the importance of maintaining near-normal glucose levels and near-normal blood pressure and lowering serum lipid levels
- Communicate with the attending physician, e.g., family physician, internist, or endocrinologist, regarding eye examination findings
- Provide patients whose conditions fail to respond to surgery and for whom further treatment is unavailable with professional support and offer referral for counseling, rehabilitative, or social services as appropriate
- Refer patients with functionally limiting postoperative visual impairment for vision rehabilitation (see [www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](http://www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab)) and social services

**Anti-VEGF** = anti-vascular endothelial growth factor; **CI-DME** = center-involved diabetic macular edema; **NCI-DME** = noncenter-involved diabetic macular edema; **NPDR** = nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy; **PDR** = proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
\* Treatments that may be considered include intravitreal corticosteroids or anti-VEGF agents. Data from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network in 2011 demonstrated that, at two years of follow-up, intravitreal ranibizumab with prompt or deferred laser surgery resulted in greater visual acuity gain and intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide plus laser surgery also resulted in greater visual gain in pseudophakic eyes compared with laser surgery alone. Individuals receiving the intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents may be re-examined as early as one month following injection.
† For patients with good visual acuity (20/25 or better) and CI-DME, there is no difference between observation plus aflibercept if visual acuity decreases, focal laser surgery plus aflibercept if visual acuity decreases, or anti-VEGF treatment. It is appropriate to defer treatment until visual acuity is worse than 20/25. Exceptions include hyperlipidemia or failed resolution associated with heart failure, renal failure, pregnancy, or any other causes that may aggravate macular edema. Deferral of photocoagulation for a brief period for medical treatment may be considered in these cases. Also, deferral of NCI-DME treatment is an option when the visual acuity is excellent (better than 20/32), close follow-up is possible, and the patient understands the risks.
\‡ Or at shorter intervals if signs approaching those of severe NPDR appear.
## Idiopathic Epiretinal Membrane and Vitreomacular Traction
**(Initial Evaluation and Therapy)**
### Initial Exam (Key elements)
- Ocular history (e.g., posterior vitreous detachment, uveitis, retinal breaks, retinal vein occlusions, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, ocular inflammatory diseases, recent wound healing)
- Duration of symptoms (e.g., metamorphopsia, difficulty using both eyes together, and diplopia)
- Systemic history
### Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the macula, vitreoretinal interface, and optic disc
- An indirect peripheral retinal examination with scleral depression to evaluate for retinal breaks and pathology
- Amsler grid test
- Watzke-Allen test
### Diagnostic Tests
- OCT to diagnose and characterize VMA, ERM, VMT, and associated retinal changes
- Fluorescein angiogram or OCTA may be helpful to evaluate ERMs and/or VMT
### Management Plan
- The decision to intervene surgically in patients with ERM/VMT usually depends upon the severity of symptoms, especially the impact on daily activities
- Patients should be informed that the majority of ERMs will remain stable and do not require therapy
- Patients should be reassured that there is a very successful surgical procedure that could address worsening symptoms or decreasing visual acuity
- Risks versus benefits of vitrectomy surgery should be discussed. Risks include decreased visual acuity, cataract, retinal tears, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis.
### Surgery and Postoperative Care
- Vitrectomy surgery is often indicated in patients who are affected by a decrease in visual acuity, metamorphopsia, double vision, or difficulty using their eyes together
- Patients should be examined postoperatively day 1, and again 1 to 2 weeks following surgery, or sooner depending upon the development of new symptoms or new findings during early postoperative examination
### Follow-up Physical Exam:
- Interval history, including new symptoms
- Measurement of IOP
- Slit lamp biomicroscopy of anterior segment
- Indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy of peripheral retina
- Counseling on use of postoperative medications
- Counseling on signs and symptoms of retinal detachment
- Precautions on intraocular gas if used
- Referral to a strabismus specialist or orthoptist (if indicated)
### Patient Education and Follow-up
- Comparing OCT images in the abnormal versus normal eye can aid patient understanding
- Patients should be encouraged to periodically test their central vision monocularly to detect changes that may occur over time, like increasing metamorphopsia and/or development of a small central scotoma
- Patients should be informed to notify their ophthalmologist promptly if they have symptoms such as an increase of floaters, loss of visual field, metamorphopsia, or a decrease in visual acuity
- Patients with functionally limiting postoperative visual impairment should be referred for vision rehabilitation (see www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab) and social services
## Idiopathic Macular Hole (Initial Evaluation and Therapy)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Duration of symptoms such as reduced visual acuity, metamorphopsia, floaters, micropsia, central scotoma
- Ocular history: glaucoma, retinal detachment or tear, other eye diseases, eye or head injuries, ocular surgery, or sun or eclipse gazing or use of a laser pointer or other laser
- Medications that may be related to macular cystoid edema (e.g., systemic niacin, topical prostaglandin analogues, topical epinephrine, tamoxifen)
### Examination (Key elements)
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of the macula and the vitreoretinal interface
- Indirect peripheral retinal examination
- Amsler grid test
- Watzke-Allen test
### Ancillary Test
- OCT is extremely helpful and offers detailed information about the macular anatomy size if an FTMH is present, and presence of any VMT or epiretinal membrane. This information aids in diagnosis, staging, and follow-up.
### Management Recommendations for Macular Hole
| Stage      | Management               | Follow-up                                                                                                      |
|------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-A and 1-B | Observation              | - Follow-up at 2–4 month intervals in the absence of new symptoms                                              |
|            |                          | - Recommend prompt return if new visual symptoms develop                                                       |
|            |                          | - Encourage monocular visual acuity testing with Amsler grid                                                   |

\* Several small case series have shown promising results with this technique for smaller holes
† Although surgery is usually performed, observation may also be appropriate in selected cases such as smaller holes and/or better visual acuity
### Surgical and Postoperative Care if Patient Receives Treatment
- Patients should be informed about relative risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery, including the risk of cataract development or progression, and the need for use of expansile intraocular gas or facedown positioning postoperatively
- Formulate a postoperative care plan and inform the patient of these arrangements
- Patients should be informed of possible postoperative increase in IOP
- Examine postoperatively within 1 or 2 days and again 1 to 2 weeks after surgery
- Components of follow-up visit should include interval history, visual acuity measurement, measurement of IOP, slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior chamber and central retina, and indirect ophthalmoscopy of the peripheral retina, and OCT evaluation to document post-op macular anatomy
## Idiopathic Macular Hole
**(Initial Evaluation and Therapy) (continued)**
### Patient Education
- Patients should be informed to notify their ophthalmologist promptly if they have symptoms such as an increase in floaters, a loss of visual field, metamorphopsia, or a decrease in visual acuity.
- Patients should be informed that air travel, travel to higher or lower altitudes, or general anesthesia with nitrous oxide should be avoided until the gas tamponade is nearly completely gone.
- Patients who have had a macular hole in one eye should be informed that they have a 10% to 15% chance of macular hole formation in the fellow eye, especially if the vitreous remains attached.
- Patients with functionally limiting postoperative visual impairment should be referred for vision rehabilitation (see [www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](https://www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab)) and social services.
## Posterior Vitreous Detachment, Retinal Breaks and Lattice Degeneration (Initial and Follow-up Evaluation)
### Initial Exam History (Key elements)
- Symptoms of PVD
- Family history of RRD, related genetic disorders (e.g., Stickler syndrome)
- Prior ocular trauma
- History of myopia
- History of ocular surgery including refractive lens exchange and cataract surgery
- History of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy
- History of intravitreal injection
### Ophthalmic Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity testing
- Confrontation visual field examination
- Pupillary assessment for the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect
- Examination of the vitreous for hemorrhage, detachment, and pigmented cells
- Examination of the peripheral fundus using scleral depression. The preferred method of evaluating peripheral vitreoretinal pathology is with indirect ophthalmoscopy combined with scleral depression.
### Diagnostic Tests
- Optical coherence tomography may be helpful to evaluate and stage the PVD
- Perform B-scan ultrasonography if peripheral retina cannot be evaluated
- If no abnormalities are found, frequent follow-up examinations are recommended (i.e., every 1-2 weeks initially)
### Management:
- Patients should be informed about the relative risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery.
### Follow-up
#### Follow-up History
- Changes in visual symptoms
- Interval history of eye trauma, intraocular injection, or intraocular surgery
#### Follow-up Physical Exam
- Visual acuity
- Evaluation of the vitreous status, with attention to the presence of pigment, hemorrhage, or syneresis
- Examination of the peripheral fundus with scleral depression or a fundus contact or non-contact lens using the slit-lamp biomicroscope
- Wide-field photography may help but does not replace careful ophthalmoscopy
- Optical coherence tomography if vitreomacular traction is present and to document presence of a developing PVD
- B-scan ultrasonography if the media are opaque
### Patient Education
- Patients at high risk of developing retinal detachment should be educated about the symptoms of PVD and retinal detachment and the value of periodic follow-up exams
- Patients who undergo refractive surgery should be informed they remain at risk of RRD despite reduction of their refractive error

PVD = posterior vitreous detachment; RRD = rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
## Retinal and Ophthalmic Artery Occlusions (Initial Evaluation and Therapy)
### History (Key elements)
- Duration of vision loss
- Symptoms of GCA (e.g., vision loss, headaches, scalp tenderness, malaise, fatigue, temporal tenderness, jaw claudication, weakness, fever, myalgia, and diplopia)
- Medications
- Family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, systemic hypertension, or hyperlipidemia
- Medical history (e.g., systemic hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hemoglobinopathy and polymyalgia rheumatica) or drug history (e.g., cocaine)
- Ocular history (e.g., trauma, other eye diseases, ocular injections, surgery)
- Social history (e.g., smoking)
### Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- Measurement of IOP
- Gonioscopy when IOP is elevated or when iris neovascularization risk is suspected (prior to dilation)
- Relative afferent pupil defect assessment
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the posterior pole
- Examination of the peripheral retina using indirect ophthalmoscopy through a dilated pupil to assess: retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, retinal emboli, retinal vasculature “boxcarring,” and optic disc neovascularization and/or neovascularization elsewhere
### Diagnostic Tests
These may be considered but should not delay transfer to a stroke center in cases of acute, nonarteritic RAO:
- Color and red-free fundus photography
- OCT
- OCT angiography
- Fluorescein angiography
- Indocyanine green angiography
- Ultrasonography in the setting of significant media opacity (to rule out other acute causes of vision loss)
- Ophthalmotonometry
### Care Management
- Physicians should first consider GCA in patients 50 years of age or older
- In cases of GCA, physicians should consider urgent systemic corticosteroid therapy to prevent vision loss in the fellow eye or vascular occlusion elsewhere
- Patients with diabetes with GCA should be carefully monitored since systemic corticosteroid treatment may destabilize glucose control
- Ophthalmologists should refer patients with retinal vascular disease to the appropriate setting, depending on the nature of the retinal occlusion
- Acute, symptomatic OAO, CRAO, and BRAO from embolic etiologies should prompt an immediate referral to the nearest stroke center or emergency department for prompt assessment for consideration of intervention
- When presented with an asymptomatic BRAO, clinicians should conduct a systemic evaluation (careful medical history, assessment for systemic disease), preferably in conjunction with the patient’s internist
### Patient Follow-up
- Follow-up should consider the extent of retinal or ocular ischemia neovascularization. Patients with greater ischemia require more frequent follow-up.
- Many patients with retinal vascular disease will lose substantial vision despite various treatment options and should be referred for appropriate social services and vision rehabilitation (see [aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](https://www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab))
- Follow-up evaluation includes a history (symptoms, systemic conditions) and examination (visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy with iris examination, measurement of IOP, undilated gonioscopy for iris and angle neovascularization especially when IOP is elevated, biomicroscopic exam of posterior pole after dilation, and peripheral retinal vitreous exam when indicated. Diagnostic tests can be considered: OCT imaging, OCTA, fluorescein angiography, or fundus photography)
- Patients with asymptomatic BRAO and/or asymptomatic arterial plaque should be referred to a primary care physician
## Retinal Vein Occlusions (Initial Evaluation and Therapy)
### Initial Exam (Key elements)
- Location and duration of vision loss
- Current medications, history of smoking, recreational drug use
- Medical history (e.g., systemic hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, coagulopathies, thrombotic disorders, pulmonary embolus)
- Ocular history (e.g., glaucoma, other ophthalmologic disorders, ocular injections, surgery, including retinal laser surgery, cataract surgery, refractive surgery)
### Physical Exam (Key elements)
- Visual acuity
- Pupillary assessment for relative afferent pupillary defect that corresponds to level of ischemia and predictive risk for neovascularization
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy for fine, abnormal, new iris vessels
- Measurement of IOP
- Gonioscopy prior to dilation, especially in cases of an ischemic CRVO, when IOP is elevated, or when iris neovascularization risk is high
- Binocular funduscopic evaluation of the posterior pole
- Examination of the peripheral retina and vitreous. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy is recommended to evaluate retinopathy of the posterior pole and midperipheral retina. Examination of the far peripheral retina is best performed using indirect or a three-mirror contact lens.
### Diagnostic Tests
- Color red-free fundus photography for documenting the severity of the retinal findings, NVE, extent of intravitreal hemorrhages and NVD
- Optical coherence tomography to detect the presence and extent of macular edema, vitreoretinal interface changes and subretinal fluid
- Fluorescein angiography to evaluate extent of vascular occlusion, degree of ischemia, and extent of macular edema
- Optical coherence tomography angiography to detect capillary nonperfusion, enlarged foveal avascular zone, and vascular abnormalities
- Ultrasonography (e.g., when vitreous hemorrhage is present)
- Artificial intelligence is being evaluated to identify RVO and is demonstrating good performance in recognizing RVO from color fundus photographs with deep learning algorithms
### Care Management
- Optimizing control of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and IOP are important to manage risk factors
- Systemic reviews have shown the efficacy of anti-VEGF agents in treating macular edema associated with RVO
- Laser surgery treatment remains a viable treatment in eyes with BRVO
- Peripheral panretinal photocoagulation is still recommended for neovascularization when complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or iris neovascularization occur
- Ophthalmologists caring for patients with retinal vascular occlusion should be familiar with specific recommendations of relevant clinical trials due to the complexity of diagnosis and treatment
### Patient Follow-up
- Follow-up evaluation includes a history of changes in symptoms and systemic status (pregnancy, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and blood glucose) and examination (visual acuity, undilated slit-lamp biomicroscopy and gonioscopy) monthly for 6 months with CRVO and in eyes with ischemic CRVO after discontinuing anti-VEGF to detect neovascularization, pupillary assessment for a relative afferent pupillary defect, measurement of IOP, stereoscopic exam of posterior pole and dilation, OCT imaging, peripheral retina and vitreous exam when indicated, and fluorescein angiography
- Ophthalmologists should refer patients with an RVO to a primary care physician for appropriate management of their systemic condition and communicate results to the physician managing the patient’s ongoing care
- Risk to the fellow eye should be communicated to both the primary care provider and the patient
- Patients whose conditions fail to respond to therapy and when further treatment is unavailable should be provided with professional support and offered a referral for counseling, vision rehabilitation, or social services as appropriate (www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab)
