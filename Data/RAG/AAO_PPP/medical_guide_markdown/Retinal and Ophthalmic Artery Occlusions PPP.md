## OBJECTIVES OF PREFERRED PRACTICE PATTERN GUIDELINES
As a service to its members and the public, the American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed a series of Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that identify characteristics and components of quality eye care. Appendix 1 describes the core criteria of quality eye care.
The Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are based on the best available scientific data as interpreted by committees of knowledgeable health professionals. In some instances, such as when results of carefully conducted clinical trials are available, the data are particularly persuasive and provide clear guidance. In other instances, the committees have to rely on their collective judgment and evaluation of available evidence.
**These documents provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular individual.** While they should generally meet the needs of most patients, they cannot possibly best meet the needs of all patients. Adherence to these PPPs will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation. These practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results. It may be necessary to approach different patients’ needs in different ways. The physician must make the ultimate judgment about the propriety of the care of a particular patient in light of all of the circumstances presented by that patient. The American Academy of Ophthalmology is available to assist members in resolving ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of ophthalmic practice.
**Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual situations.** The Academy specifically disclaims any and all liability for injury or other damages of any kind, from negligence or otherwise, for any and all claims that may arise out of the use of any recommendations or other information contained herein.
References to certain drugs, instruments, and other products are made for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to constitute an endorsement of such. Such material may include information on applications that are not considered community standard, that reflect indications not included in approved U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, or that are approved for use only in restricted research settings. The FDA has stated that it is the responsibility of the physician to determine the FDA status of each drug or device he or she wishes to use, and to use them with appropriate patient consent in compliance with applicable law.
Innovation in medicine is essential to ensure the future health of the American public, and the Academy encourages the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic methods that will improve eye care. It is essential to recognize that true medical excellence is achieved only when the patients’ needs are the foremost consideration.
All Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are reviewed by their parent committee annually or earlier if developments warrant and updated accordingly. To ensure that all PPPs are current, each is valid for 5 years from the approved by date unless superseded by a revision. Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are funded by the Academy without commercial support. Authors and reviewers of PPPs are volunteers and do not receive any financial compensation for their contributions to the documents. The PPPs are externally reviewed by experts and stakeholders, including consumer representatives, before publication. The PPPs are developed in compliance with the Council of Medical Specialty Societies’ Code for Interactions with Companies. The Academy has Relationship with Industry Procedures (available at [www.aao.org/about-preferred-practice-patterns](http://www.aao.org/about-preferred-practice-patterns)) to comply with the Code.
Appendix 2 contains the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes for the disease entities that this PPP covers. The intended users of the Retinal and Ophthalmic Artery Occlusions PPP are ophthalmologists.
## METHODS AND KEY TO RATINGS
Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful information to practitioners. Where evidence exists to support a recommendation for care, the recommendation should be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence. To accomplish these aims, methods from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network1 (SIGN) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation2 (GRADE) group are used. GRADE is a systematic approach to grading the strength of the total body of evidence that is available to support recommendations on a specific clinical management issue. Organizations that have adopted GRADE include SIGN, the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Policy, and the American College of Physicians.3
- All studies used to form a recommendation for care are graded for strength of evidence individually, and that grade is listed with the study citation.
- To rate individual studies, a scale based on SIGN1 is used. The definitions and levels of evidence to rate individual studies are as follows:
| Grade   | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I++     | High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias                                     |
| I+      | Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias                                                                      |
| I-      | Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias                                                                                    |
| II++    | High-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies                                                                                              |
|         | High-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal                 |
| II+     | Well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal                |
| II-     | Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal                              |
| III     | Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series)                                                                                                          |
- Recommendations for care are formed based on the body of the evidence. The body of evidence quality ratings are defined by GRADE2 as follows:
| Quality                | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Good quality          | Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect                                                         |
| Moderate quality      | Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate                |
| Insufficient quality  | Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Any estimate of effect is very uncertain |
- Key recommendations for care are defined by GRADE2 as follows:
| Recommendation Type    | Description                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strong recommendation  | Used when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects or clearly do not   |
| Discretionary recommendation | Used when the trade-offs are less certain—either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced |
- **The Highlighted Findings and Recommendations for Care section lists points determined by the Retina/Vitreous PPP Committee to be of particular importance to vision and quality of life outcomes.**
- **All recommendations for care in this PPP were rated using the system described above. Ratings are embedded throughout the PPP main text in italics.**
- **Literature searches were undertaken on March 6, 2023, January 23, 2024, and August 8, 2024 in the PubMed database. Complete details of the literature search are available in [www.aao.org/ppp](http://www.aao.org/ppp).**
- Relevant systematic reviews were identified by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision US Satellite (CEV@US). These systematic reviews were screened by the committee and rated using the system described above by the committee methodologist.
- Recommendations are based on systematic reviews, as per the Institute of Medicine (Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust, 2011). In formulating the recommendations, the health benefits, side effects/harms/risks, and the balance of benefits and risks are reviewed and considered. Final decisions are arrived at through informal consensus techniques. If there are areas of disagreement, a vote will be conducted among the members of the guideline committee. If there are individuals with direct financial relationships in the area of disagreement, these individuals will refrain from the vote.
## HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARE
An ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), cilioretinal artery occlusion, or a branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) can be associated with life-threatening conditions (e.g., carotid occlusive or cardiac valve disease). In patients over 50 years of age, giant cell arteritis (GCA) should be suspected. When GCA is strongly suspected or diagnosed, urgent systemic corticosteroid therapy should be considered in order to preserve vision in the contralateral eye as well as prevent systemic morbidity and mortality.
Acute, symptomatic retinal or ophthalmic arterial occlusion should undergo an **immediate** referral to the nearest stroke referral center for prompt assessment for an acute intervention. The precise timing of evaluation for patients with an asymptomatic but newly diagnosed arterial occlusion is unclear, nevertheless these patients still warrant a timely referral.
An OAO or retinal artery occlusion (RAO) occurring in a patient of any age should prompt a systemic stroke evaluation to look for an embolic source. It should also include a workup for GCA in older patients (over 50 years old) and rare causes of stroke in younger patients (under 50 years old) such as vasculitis or hypercoagulability.
After the acute phase, there are no proven treatments to reverse the vision loss caused by CRAO, BRAO, or OAO. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support intra-arterial or intravenous antifibrinolytic therapy for CRAO.
In vascular occlusive disorders of the eye, there is an increased risk for posterior and/or anterior segment neovascularization. Patients with greater ischemia require frequent follow-up. Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) treatment is recommended for patients who develop iris or retinal neovascularization.
Patients with symptomatic RAO have the highest risk of stroke during the 2 weeks before and up to 1 month after the occlusion.
## INTRODUCTION
The arterial circulation to the eye involves many branches. Any one of these branches may have impaired flow that results from an obstruction. An embolus can occlude the vessel or lead to thrombus formation. Vasculitis may also lead to an occlusion or thrombus formation. In general, an obstruction of either an ophthalmic or retinal arteriole requires a careful evaluation for systemic diseases. Numerous studies have reported an association between symptomatic retinal artery occlusion (RAO) and stroke. Since the retina and brain share an embryologic origin, the retina is considered part of the central nervous system and is actually brain tissue. Treatment of a retinal ischemic event should therefore be approached the same way as a brain infarction. In 2013, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association updated their definition of ischemic stroke to include retinal cell death attributable to ischemia in their definition of central nervous system infarction. Central nervous system infarction is brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia, based on (1) pathological, imaging, or other objective evidence of cerebral, spinal cord, or retinal focal ischemic injury in a defined vascular distribution; or (2) clinical evidence of cerebral, spinal cord, or retinal focal ischemic injury based on symptoms persisting 24 hours or more or until death.
## DISEASE DEFINITION
An ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO) is a partial or complete obstruction of the ophthalmic artery (branch of the internal carotid artery) and may lead to severe ischemia of the affected globe and associated ocular tissues. A central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a partial or complete obstruction of the central retinal artery, after it branches off from the ophthalmic artery. A branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) is a partial or complete obstruction of any of the branch tributaries of the central retinal artery. Anterior retinal arterial occlusion is caused by giant cell arteritis (GCA), whereas most nonarteritic RAOs are embolic in origin.
CRAO is rare: estimated annual incidence of approximately 1.33 per 100,000 in an Olmsted County, Minnesota population or 1.8 per 100,000 person-years in an entire Korean population over age 65. The incidence likely increases with age. The average age at presentation in the United States is the early 60s. Central retinal artery occlusions have also rarely been documented in children. A CRAO commonly leads to retinal ischemia and subsequent retinal cell death.
## CLINICAL FINDINGS CHARACTERISTIC OF RETINAL AND OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION
Patients presenting with a CRAO typically describe a sudden, painless decrease in the visual acuity and field of vision in one eye that occurs over a period of seconds. In 1% to 2% of cases, occurrence is bilateral, which should raise the suspicion of a vasculitic process, such as GCA. The presenting visual acuity may vary, but most patients have severe vision loss unless they have cilioretinal sparing, and the patient may or may not have readily visible fundus abnormalities. A deep retinal whitening (i.e., from paracentral acute middle maculopathy [PAMM]) with an inner nuclear layer of hyper-reflectivity on optical coherence tomography (OCT) may be noted initially before progression to a more complete CRAO. The classic appearance of retinal whitening and a cherry red spot may be absent or very subtle in the early stages, depending largely on the timing of the examination relative to the onset of obstruction. The classic appearance of retinal whitening with the associated cherry red spot on the foveal center typically presents within several hours of onset.
(See Figure 1.) Retinal whitening is caused by opacification of the swollen, ischemic parafoveal nerve fiber layers. The cherry red spot is seen because the foveal center, free of nerve fiber layers, transmits the normal coloration of the underlying, unaffected choroid. Hence, the normally perfused tissues appear red against the ischemic background of the nerve fiber layer.

Another key finding is the slow segmental blood flow, referred to as boxcar segmentation, that is observed within the retinal arterioles and veins. Boxcar segmentation of blood in the retinal arteries and veins is best visualized by means of slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the posterior segment. Approximately 15% to 25% of eyes will have a cilioretinal artery that perfuses a portion of the macula and, thus, spares a portion of the central vision in the setting of a CRAO. In a CRAO, there are typically no intraretinal hemorrhages, and the veins will have a normal caliber. This appearance contrasts with retinal vein occlusion, which is typified by diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages and venous tortuosity and dilation.
The presenting visual acuity in a patient with an acute CRAO tends to be in the range of 20/200 to counting fingers, yet can be as good as 20/20, depending on the presence or absence of a cilioretinal artery and the degree of obstruction within the artery. In contrast, the presenting visual acuity for an OAO is usually hand motions or worse. This poor visual acuity is due to the location of the obstruction, which is proximal to the branch point of the ciliary arteries that provide flow to the choroid and portions of the optic nerve. Ophthalmic artery occlusions and CRAOs will have a relative afferent pupillary defect that is commensurate with the degree of ischemia.
Over time, an occluded artery will eventually recanalize and begin to perfuse the retina. However, the visual acuity usually remains poor. In vivo measurements of macular and nerve fiber layer thickness in RAO demonstrate that the inner retina thickens acutely, then subsequently thins from ischemia-related atrophy, and the retinal vessels usually remain attenuated in a process that appears to evolve over months. In some cases, there is a progression from PAMM to more complete inner retinal hyper-reflectivity on OCT. Iris neovascularization may develop in up to 20% of cases of CRAO, sometimes as soon as 1 week, but typically within 30 to 60 days, following a CRAO. The incidence of neovascularization, and the rapidity of its onset, is related to the level of overall ocular and retinal ischemia.

**Figure 2**: SD-OCT Scan of a case of CRAO similar to the one shown in Figure 1 with cilioretinal artery sparing shows hyper-reflectivity of the inner two-thirds of the retina in the area of clinical opacification in the affected areas. All retinal layers are identifiable in the area of retina perfused by the cilioretinal artery, adjacent to the optic nerve head. The retina in the fovea is spared from opacification, resulting in the appearance of a cherry-red spot on the examination. Subfoveal fluid is variably present in these cases. *(Courtesy of Colin A.

### Cilioretinal Artery Occlusions
Cilioretinal artery occlusions may accompany a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The cilioretinal artery occlusion occurs as a result of increased intravascular retinal venous pressure combined with the lower mean choroidal arterial pressure relative to the mean retinal arterial pressure. In cilioretinal arteries, the arterial flow originates from the short posterior ciliary arteries rather than from the central retinal artery. The lower intravascular arterial perfusion pressure in the cilioretinal artery is the result of multiple collateral flow channels that are present within the choroidal circulation. When the retinal venous circulation is occluded, flow through the cilioretinal artery is more easily impeded as a result of higher outflow resistance. Also, the ciliary circulation lacks the autoregulatory mechanism of the retinal circulation that compensates for changes in the intravascular pressure. Instead, the choroidal circulation is largely regulated by sympathetic innervation.¹
The combination of a CRAO or BRAO with a CRVO is rare; it usually is an indicator of an active systemic disease including autoimmune disorders, malignancies, blood dyscrasias, leukemia, and superior thoracic inlet lesions.² A combined CRAO or BRAO and CRVO may also occur in the setting of a retrobulbar hemorrhage. Patients with this combination of vascular occlusions will generally have both dilated and tortuous veins, along with intraretinal hemorrhages in conjunction with broad areas of retinal ischemia, infarction, poor visual function, a poor prognosis, and a high risk (80%) of neovascular glaucoma.³
### Platelet-Fibrin-Cholesterol Emboli
Platelet-fibrin-cholesterol emboli (Hollenhorst plaques) are common emboli responsible for RAOs. Emboli can appear either within a vessel of similar caliber or at an arterial bifurcation. Commonly, these plaques originate from the carotid arteries, heart valves, or the aortic arch. Rarely, calcified emboli may originate from calcified cardiac valves. The presence of asymptomatic Hollenhorst plaques should prompt a nonurgent workup for systemic atheromatous disease.
### Ophthalmic Artery Occlusions
Ophthalmic artery occlusions are usually located proximal to both the branch point of the general posterior ciliary arteries (choroidal supply) and central retinal artery (retinal supply). In a patient with an OAO, the central retinal artery and ciliary arteries that supply blood flow to the choroid are obstructed, and vision is profoundly reduced. On fundoscopic examination, a cherry red spot may not be detected because both the choroid and the retinal circulations are ischemic, with little vascular flow to the entire retina, including the foveal region. *(See Figure 3.)* When the circulation of the optic disc is involved, there may be optic disc edema.
A fluorescein angiogram will help demonstrate both retinal vascular occlusion as well as broad areas of choroidal nonperfusion. A dark ring of both choroidal and retinal nonperfusion may be seen surrounding the optic nerve in OAO as well as lobular or triangular areas of patchy choroidal nonperfusion *(as is seen with GCA).* The posterior pole or peripheral areas of triangular ischemia, also referred to as Amaurosis triangle, is a reflection of the choroidal vascular flow distribution.

### PATIENT POPULATION
The incidence of RAOs increases with age. The incidence patterns for CRAO and BRAO are similar, increasing with age (peaking near age 80) and occurring more frequently in men.
### CLINICAL OBJECTIVES
- Identify patients at risk for developing RAO
- Reduce the risk of severe ocular complications (e.g., further vision loss, neovascular glaucoma) or associated systemic conditions (e.g., cerebral and myocardial infarction)
- Diagnose and treat GCA
- Mitigate RAO risk factors, including smoking cessation and control of chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and lipid disorders)
- Monitor for signs of retinal or anterior segment angiogenesis that may lead to further complications, such as vitreous hemorrhage or neovascular glaucoma
- Provide or refer for visual rehabilitation services when a patient has visual impairment from the disease
## BACKGROUND
### INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
According to U.S. epidemiologic data from Olmsted County, Minnesota, the annual incidence of developing a CRAO is 1.3 per 100,000 with a mean age at presentation of 74.3 years (range, 46–90 years). Similarly, the incidence reported from the entire Korean population was 1.8 per 100,000 person-years, increasing with age.
In an Australian study of 3654 subjects over 49 years of age screened by means of a detailed eye examination, asymptomatic retinal emboli were present in about 1.4% of the population (95% confidence interval = 1.0–1.8), increasing with age.
In the 10-year follow-up of this cohort from the Blue Mountains Eye Study, the incidence of retinal emboli increased to 3% in the 1952 survivors.
Age was the key risk factor and there was not a significant gender predilection.
## RISK FACTORS
Cigarette smoking, hypertension, body mass index, high serum lipid levels, diabetes, coagulopathy and cardiac disease (including atrial fibrillation) are all important modifiable risk factors associated with retinal emboli.
One study suggested that controlling hypertension could decrease the risk of future RAOs.
Two studies suggested that a low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol is an independent risk factor for RAO.
A claims-based study did not find an association between RAO and female hormonal therapy.
Cosmetic filler injections have become an increasing cause of RAO.
## NATURAL HISTORY
Central RAOs are due to vascular embolic obstruction in 95% of cases.
One study reviewed a large number of ocular vascular occlusive cases and found that spontaneous visual acuity improvement occurred in 22% of eyes with nonarteritic CRAO, with final visual acuity of 20/400 or worse in 61% of these eyes.
Overall, less than 10% of patients report a meaningful recovery of vision for nonarteritic CRAO.
## RATIONALE FOR TREATMENT
Acute, symptomatic OAO, CRAO, and BRAO are medical emergencies and require prompt evaluation.
Such occlusions may occur from an important clinical underlying cause of embolism, inflammatory, infectious, or other processes that may require a systemic medical evaluation that is both urgent and targeted to the patient’s presentation and medical history.
Although it only accounts for 1% of CRAOs, GCA represents an ophthalmologic emergency and should be considered in elderly patients with CRAO.
White individuals over age 50 are more typically affected by GCA.
These patients present with clinical findings of optic disc swelling, CRAO, and absence of emboli.
Often, there is a history of headache, temporal tenderness, jaw claudication, weight loss, proximal myalgia, or fever.
However, around 20% of patients have no vision loss without any systemic symptoms of GCA (occult GCA).
Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels are typically elevated.
In cases of GCA, prompt initiation of systemic corticosteroid therapy is critical to prevent vision loss in the fellow eye or vascular occlusion elsewhere.
Patients with GCA who also have diabetes should be monitored carefully in this situation due to the potential for systemic corticosteroid treatment to destabilize glucose control.
Growing evidence recommends that acute RAO (symptoms within 24 hours) be treated as a medical emergency and be referred immediately to an emergency department or stroke center facility for neurological evaluation due to the increased risk of central nervous system stroke.
Following a CRAO, the risk of ischemic stroke is highest during the first 1 to 4 weeks, ranging from 3% to 6% in two studies.
Up to 24% of patients with RAO have concurrent cerebrovascular accidents on diffusion-weighted MRI.
In one study, 112 consecutive patients with acute RAO (with either transient or fixed symptoms) were evaluated prospectively in a single center, and all underwent brain MRI acutely (within 24 hours). The majority (77/112) had CRAO or BRAO confirmed by ophthalmologic exam. Silent brain infarction, as evidenced by diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities, was present in 19% of CRAO and 25% of BRAO subjects.
These rates are similar to rates that have been reported in patients with amaurosis or cerebral hemispheric transient ischemic attack (TIA) in other studies.
Patients with symptomatic RAO have the highest risk of stroke during the 2 weeks before and 1 month after the occlusion.
A meta-analysis found a higher rate of acute stroke in patients with RAO than in patients without RAO.
Current evidence for effective interventional treatment for the ocular condition, other than corticosteroids for GCA, is controversial and limited to level III data.
Thrombolytic or interventional treatment...
Treatments that attempted to preserve or recover vision in CRAO or BRAO have not been well studied in large randomized clinical trials. However, a 2020 comprehensive literature review reported 7 manuscripts with 111 patients receiving some form of thrombolytic therapy with minimal adverse events and some reported benefit if the reperfusion therapies were administered early following the acute event (within 4 to 5 hours, which is the same cutoff used for intravenous thrombolysis in acute CNS stroke). The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (100% oxygen over 9 hours) has demonstrated efficacy over observation alone in several small retrospective studies. However, a Cochrane review concluded that evidence is uncertain regarding interventions and well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed. *(L - Insufficient quality)*
Silent brain infarction is a frequent finding in patients with acute BRAO/CRAO or amaurosis fugax, and these silent infarctions convey a high risk for future stroke. These patients should undergo prompt referral to a stroke center.
Panretinal photocoagulation surgery (PRP) with or without anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is recommended for patients who develop neovascularization of the retina, iris, or angle. Although PRP will not improve the visual acuity or field of vision, it decreases VEGF production and limits the progression in neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma. In acute cases, the provider may elect to initiate treatment with an off-label intravitreal anti-VEGF agent to supplement or to help facilitate PRP treatment.
## CARE PROCESS
### PATIENT OUTCOME CRITERIA
Patient outcome criteria include the following:
- Improvement or stabilization of visual function
- Improvement or stabilization of vision-related quality of life
- Reduction of the risk of severe consequences (e.g., further vision loss, neovascular glaucoma) or cerebral and myocardial infarction
- Identification of life-threatening conditions (e.g., GCA, carotid occlusive or cardiac valve disease)
- Encouragement to cease smoking
- Identification or optimization of control of chronic systemic diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation)
- Establishment of effective communication with the patient’s primary care physician about the status of the retinal disease and its relation to systemic disease
### DIAGNOSIS
The initial examination of a patient includes all aspects of a comprehensive medical eye evaluation, with particular attention to those aspects relevant to retinal vascular disease.
The investigation should begin with a medical history, including any known systemic disease, combined with a review of systems for embolic disease (e.g., transient ischemic symptoms, lateralizing weakness, paresthesias). Also, a detailed history should help the clinician direct the evaluation. Documenting the patient’s demographics, underlying systemic diseases, as well as social history (e.g., smoking) and family history are important. The ophthalmologist needs to pay particular attention to symptoms associated with GCA (e.g., vision loss, headaches, scalp tenderness, malaise, fatigue, temporal tenderness, jaw claudication, weakness, fever, diplopia, polymyalgia rheumatica) in patients over age 50.
An ESR, CRP, and complete blood count with platelets should be obtained on all elderly patients over the age of 50 years with CRAO/OAO unless there is a clear causative plaque on examination, especially if the patient has GCA symptoms. It is rare for GCA to cause a BRAO because it tends to affect medium- to large-sized arteries and spares the smaller arterioles. Although ESR and CRP are almost always elevated in GCA, normal ESR and CRP do not completely rule it.
### History
An initial history for retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusion should consider the following elements:
- Duration of vision loss
- Symptoms of GCA (e.g., vision loss, headaches, scalp tenderness, malaise, fatigue, temporal tenderness, jaw claudication, weakness, fever, myalgia, and diplopia)
- Medications
- Family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, systemic hypertension, or hyperlipidemia
- Medical history (e.g., systemic hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hemoglobinopathy, and polymyalgia rheumatica) or drug history (e.g., cocaine)
- Ocular history (e.g., trauma, other eye diseases, ocular injections, surgery)
- Social history (e.g., smoking)
### Examination
The initial examination should include the following elements:
- Visual acuity
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
- Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement
- Gonioscopy when neovascularization of the iris is present or suspected, or when the IOP is elevated. Neovascularization of the iris or the anterior chamber angle is best recognized prior to dilation, can rarely be seen in an acute arterial occlusion, and can occur up to 6 months later.
- **Assessment of pupils** to look for a relative afferent pupillary defect and a Horner syndrome
- **Fundoscopy**:
  - Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the posterior pole
  - Examination of the peripheral retina using indirect ophthalmoscopy through a dilated pupil. This is necessary to assess for the following features that are often associated with severe vision loss:
    - Retinal hemorrhages
    - Cotton wool spots
    - Retinal emboli
    - Retinal vascular “boxcarring”
    - Optic disc neovascularization and/or neovascularization elsewhere
## Diagnostic Tests
Several tests ancillary to the clinical examination may be considered, but they should not delay transfer to a stroke center in cases of acute, nonarteritic RAO. The most common tests include the following:
- Color and red-free fundus photography
- OCT
- OCT angiography
- Fluorescein angiography
- Indocyanine green angiography
- Ultrasonography in the setting of significant media opacity (to rule out other acute causes of vision loss such as retinal detachment)
- Ophthalmodynamometry⁸⁰
### Color Fundus Photography
Fundus photography is useful for documenting the severity of the retinal findings, vascular caliber, retinal hemorrhages, the presence and characteristics of intravascular emboli, and the presence of any new vessels in the retina or near the optic disc.
### Optical Coherence Tomography
Optical coherence tomography provides high-resolution imaging of the retinal anatomy and thickness and of the vitreoretinal interface, and it detects other forms of macular disease in patients with RAO. In acute RAO, the first sign may be PAMM (a deep retinal whitening with an inner nuclear layer of hyper-reflectivity).²¹ ²⁴ Thickening and increased inner retinal reflectivity will be present in the acute setting, followed by inner retinal thinning in chronic RAO.⁸¹
### Fluorescein and Indocyanine Green Angiography
Fluorescein or indocyanine green (ICG) angiography may help demonstrate alterations in the arterial and choroidal flow patterns such as delays in flow and ischemia and may also document the extent of retinal vasculature involvement. The ICG angiogram provides better images of the choroidal circulation than fluorescein angiogram and can be helpful, especially in a patient with GCA. The infrared absorption and emission characteristics of the ICG dye enable deeper imaging that may be blocked on fluorescein angiography. The fluorescein angiogram helps to differentiate the origin and extent of the RAO(s).
Although fluorescein angiography remains a valuable tool for physicians who diagnose and treat patients with retinal vascular disease, there are potential risks associated with the procedure. Severe medical complications may occur, including death, which has been reported in approximately 1 per 200,000 patients.⁸² Pregnancy and the postpartum state are also contraindications for its use.
## Ultrasonography
Ultrasonography may be helpful to assess the anatomic status of the retina in the presence of a significant vitreous hemorrhage or other media opacity.
### Ophthalmodynamometry
Ophthalmodynamometry may be especially helpful for distinguishing ocular ischemia/ophthalmic artery occlusion from venous obstruction during retinal examination.
## MANAGEMENT
Acute, symptomatic, posterior segment arterial occlusions represent an emergent ophthalmic condition and require prompt evaluation. Such occlusions may be partial or complete, depending on whether there is evidence of blood flow. These vascular occlusions may represent an important clinical indicator of a more severe systemic disorder or of an embolic, inflammatory, infectious, or other process that require a systemic medical evaluation that is both urgent and targeted to the patient as well as to the patient’s presentation and medical history. The rate of silent cerebral ischemia in RAO is the same as in hemispheric TIA, and the recommendation from multiple clinical trials is that a TIA be worked up as stroke in the acute phase. Given the expected similarity of pathogenesis, patients with RAO should be considered in the same way. Immediate referral to an emergency department affiliated with a stroke center for a medical evaluation is advised. If a stroke center is not available, an emergency department is the next option.
In general, there are no proven therapies or treatments for symptomatic nonarteritic RAOs. There are case reports, small case series, and uncontrolled studies that suggest that several potential interventions may be helpful. However, there are no level I data to support any single specific therapy.
A Cochrane review concluded that evidence about interventions is uncertain, and well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed. Conservative treatments of acute CRAO have included digital massage, anterior chamber paracentesis, vasodilation, breathing into a paper bag, oxygen therapy, and topical pressure-lowering therapies. However, none of these interventions has demonstrated significant benefit when compared with the natural history of the disorder. In fact, a meta-analysis suggested that eyes receiving conservative therapy may do worse than controls.
Retrospective case series have suggested hyperbaric oxygen has a mild benefit in CRAO, but there is not enough evidence to prove it is effective without a randomized clinical trial. More aggressive treatments, such as anterior chamber paracentesis, thrombolysis, or transluminal neodymium yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser embolysis, have associated risks and cannot be currently recommended in the absence of strong evidence-based data.
The concept of eye stroke protocols in emergency departments is being implemented in some centers and protocols are overseen by ophthalmologists. These involve implementation of fundus cameras, often with OCTs, in the emergency department to allow rapid assessment of patients presenting with acute vision loss.
Both intra-arterial and intravenous thrombolytics have been investigated. Although some visual benefit has been shown with intravenous thrombolysis, proponents of local intra-arterial therapy to the ophthalmic artery believe there is reduced risk of systemic complications and potential for greater benefit.
Beginning in 1984, many studies ranging in size and methodology have examined the utility and safety of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute CRAO with mixed results.
In 2021, a retrospective consecutive interventional case series of 15 patients presenting with CRAO showed that intra-arterial tPA was safe and showed significant visual improvement. More than half the patients in this study had a clinically significant improvement in visual acuity of 3 or more Snellen lines. Notably, 75% of those who responded to treatment showed a substantial change in visual acuity, with improvement of at least 4 lines. A subset of patients (4/15, 27%) improved from counting fingers or worse to 20/80 or better.
Although placebo-controlled studies are lacking, a systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that the administration of intravenous thrombolytics within 4.5 hours of symptom onset was associated with a greater likelihood of favorable visual outcomes.
Even though retrospective studies have suggested improved outcomes with thrombolytics when given acutely, there remains strong controversy about the best management strategy. There are meaningful limitations to establishing a reliable study design for such trials, especially given the complexity in disease variables and timing for intervention. Also, the low incidence of symptomatic arterial occlusions, especially within optimal time constraints, limits enrollment of patients for interventional studies. The need for systemic testing and prompt intervention creates urgency and severely limits the study design. There are currently three ongoing randomized clinical trials evaluating intravenous thrombolysis for acute CRAO ongoing in Europe.
The American Heart Association recommends modification of current hospital stroke protocols to include CRAO and related syndromes. Although the American Heart Association states that intravenous or intra-arterial antifibrinolytic therapy can be “considered” for acute CRAO if within 4.5 and 6 hours from symptom onset, respectively, at this point there is insufficient evidence to definitively know if thrombolysis leads to better visual outcomes. In addition, there is a small risk of hemorrhagic stroke with thrombolytics, which must be weighed in the decision making with the patient.
Physicians who manage a cilioretinal artery occlusion should first consider GCA in patients over 50 years of age and manage as per CRAO. Patients with CRAO, BRAO, or concomitant retinal artery and vein occlusions should be followed for the development of neovascularization.
Parental photo-coagulation surgery is occasionally required in RAO and should be postponed until neovascularization is detected. However, in the presence of anterior segment neovascularization, and eyes with neovascular glaucoma or prompt PRP or prompt anti-VEGF therapy with gaze:
### Examination
- Visual acuity<sup>114</sup>
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with iris examination<sup>115</sup>
- IOP measurement
- Undilated gonioscopy for iris and angle neovascularization, especially when the IOP is elevated<sup>115</sup>
- Biomicroscopic examination of the posterior pole after dilation of the pupils<sup>116</sup>
- Peripheral retina and vitreous examination, when indicated<sup>117</sup>
The following diagnostic testing can be considered:
- OCT imaging
- OCT angiography
- Fluorescein angiography
- Fundus photography
### PROVIDER AND SETTING
Although the ophthalmologist will perform the examination and all ocular surgery, trained individuals under the ophthalmologist’s supervision and review may perform certain aspects of data collection, such as imaging. Because diabetes mellitus is a common contributor to RAO, the ophthalmologist caring for patients with this condition may wish to become familiar with the Diabetic Retinopathy PPP.<sup>118</sup>
### COUNSELING AND REFERRAL
A patient with an asymptomatic BRAO and/or asymptomatic arterial plaque should be referred to a primary care physician for evaluation and management of relevant systemic condition(s). Acute, symptomatic patients with RAO should be referred immediately to an emergency department affiliated with a stroke center at presentation.<sup>119</sup> Examination results should be communicated promptly to the physician(s) managing the patient.
Most patients with RAO or OAO will lose substantial vision despite various treatment options. Patients who fail to respond and those for whom further treatment is unavailable should be provided with proper professional support and considered for referrals for counseling, vision rehabilitation, or as appropriate. Patients with functionally limiting visual impairment should be considered for referral for vision rehabilitation and social services.<sup>120</sup> Empathic communication and questioning by the provider is helpful to elicit the patients’ concerns. Referrals for counseling, vocational rehabilitation, and or peer support groups should be considered for patients with depression, anxiety, and loss of independence or employment.<sup>121</sup> More information on vision rehabilitation, including materials for patients, is available at [www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab).
## APPENDIX 1. QUALITY OF OPHTHALMIC CARE CORE CRITERIA
*Providing quality care
is the physician's foremost ethical obligation, and is
the basis of public trust in physicians.*
**AMA Board of Trustees, 1986**
Quality ophthalmic care is provided in a manner and with the skill that is consistent with the best interests of the patient. The discussion that follows characterizes the core elements of such care.
The ophthalmologist is first and foremost a physician. As such, the ophthalmologist demonstrates compassion and concern for the individual and utilizes the science and art of medicine to help alleviate patient fear and suffering. The ophthalmologist strives to develop and maintain clinical skills at the highest feasible level, consistent with the needs of patients, through training and continuing education. The ophthalmologist evaluates those skills and medical knowledge in relation to the needs of the patient and responds accordingly. The ophthalmologist also ensures that needy patients receive necessary care directly or through referral to appropriate persons and facilities that will provide such care, and he or she supports activities that promote health and prevent disease and disability.
The ophthalmologist recognizes that disease places patients in a disadvantaged, dependent state. The ophthalmologist respects the dignity and integrity of his or her patients and does not exploit their vulnerability.
Quality ophthalmic care has the following optimal attributes, among others.
- The essence of quality care is a meaningful partnership relationship between patient and physician. The ophthalmologist strives to communicate effectively with his or her patients, listening carefully to their needs and concerns. In turn, the ophthalmologist educates his or her patients about the nature and prognosis of their condition and about proper and appropriate therapeutic modalities. This is to ensure their meaningful participation (appropriate to their unique physical, intellectual and emotional state) in decisions affecting their management and care, to improve their motivation and compliance with the agreed plan of treatment, and to help alleviate their fears and concerns.
- The ophthalmologist uses his or her best judgment in choosing and timing appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic modalities as well as the frequency of evaluation and follow-up, with due regard to the urgency and nature of the patient's condition and unique needs and desires.
- The ophthalmologist carries out only those procedures for which he or she is adequately trained, experienced and competent, or, when necessary, is assisted by someone who is, depending on the urgency of the problem and availability and accessibility of alternative providers.
- Patients are assured access to, and continuity of, needed and appropriate ophthalmic care, which can be described as follows:
  - The ophthalmologist treats patients with due regard to timeliness, appropriateness, and his or her own ability to provide such care.
  - The operating ophthalmologist makes adequate provision for appropriate pre- and postoperative patient care.
  - When the ophthalmologist is unavailable for his or her patient, he or she provides appropriate alternate ophthalmic care, with adequate mechanisms for informing patients of the existence of such care and procedures for obtaining it.
  - The ophthalmologist refers patients to other ophthalmologists and eye care providers based on the timeliness and appropriateness of such referral, the patient’s needs, the competence and qualifications of the person to whom the referral is made, and access and availability.
  - The ophthalmologist seeks appropriate consultation with due regard to the nature of the ocular or other medical or surgical problems. Consultants are suggested for their skill, competence, and accessibility. They receive as complete and accurate an accounting of the problem as necessary to provide efficient and effective advice or intervention, and in turn respond in an adequate and timely manner.
  - The ophthalmologist maintains complete and accurate medical records.
- On appropriate request, the ophthalmologist provides a full and accurate rendering of the patient's records in his or her possession.
- The ophthalmologist reviews the results of consultations and laboratory tests in a timely and effective manner and takes appropriate actions.
- The ophthalmologist and those who assist in providing care identify themselves and their profession.
- For patients whose conditions fail to respond to treatment and for whom further treatment is unavailable, the ophthalmologist provides proper professional support, counseling, rehabilitative and social services, and referral as appropriate and accessible.
- Prior to therapeutic or invasive diagnostic procedures, the ophthalmologist becomes appropriately conversant with the patient's condition by collecting pertinent historical information and performing relevant preoperative examinations. Additionally, he or she enables the patient to reach a fully informed decision by providing an accurate and truthful explanation of the diagnosis; the nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and probability of success of the proposed treatment and of alternative treatment; and the risks and benefits of no treatment.
- The ophthalmologist adopts new technology (e.g., drugs, devices, surgical techniques) in judicious fashion, appropriate to the cost and potential benefit relative to existing alternatives and to its demonstrated safety and efficacy.
- The ophthalmologist enhances the quality of care he or she provides by periodically reviewing and assessing his or her personal performance in relation to established standards, and by revising or altering his or her practices and techniques appropriately.
- The ophthalmologist improves ophthalmic care by communicating to colleagues, through appropriate professional channels, knowledge gained through clinical research and practice. This includes alerting colleagues of instances of unusual or unexpected rates of complications and problems related to new drugs, devices or procedures.
- The ophthalmologist provides care in suitably staffed and equipped facilities adequate to deal with potential ocular and systemic complications requiring immediate attention.
- The ophthalmologist also provides ophthalmic care in a manner that is cost effective without unacceptably compromising accepted standards of quality.

### Additional Information:
- For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available.
- When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4<sup>th</sup> digit, 5<sup>th</sup> digit, or 6<sup>th</sup> digit):
  - Right is always 1
  - Left is always 2
  - Bilateral is always 3
