## JOINT POLICY STATEMENT
### Glasses as a Medical Necessity
A joint statement of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus and the American Academy of Ophthalmology
### Policy
Glasses are medically necessary to prevent permanent visual loss due to a number of eye conditions in children. These conditions include high or asymmetric refractive error, strabismus, amblyopia, aphakia, pseudophakia, congenital ocular anomalies, neurologic disorders, medication side effects, and for protection in cases where the child has only one well-functioning eye.
