In 2019, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) created the Task Force on Myopia in recognition of the substantial global increases in myopia prevalence and its associated complications. The Task Force, led by Richard L. Abbott, MD, and Donald Tan, MD, comprised recognized experts in myopia prevention and treatment, public health experts from around the world, and organization representatives from the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Optometry, and American Academy of Pediatrics. The Academy’s Board of Trustees believes that myopia is a high-priority cause of visual impairment, warranting a timely evaluation and synthesis of the scientific literature and formulation of an action plan to address the issue from different perspectives. This includes education of physicians and other health care providers, patients and their families, schools, and local and national public health agencies; defining health policies to ameliorate patients’ access to appropriate therapy and to promote effective public health interventions; and fostering promising avenues of research. _Ophthalmology 2021;128:816-826 © 2020 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology_

Myopia is a common ocular condition and an increasing cause of visual impairment globally. Myopia prevalence has been rising over the past several decades, especially in East Asia, with projections of even greater growth in the next 50 years. Holden et al. estimated that the number of myopic individuals (–0.50 diopter [D] or more myopia) and the prevalence of myopia would grow from 1406 million people (22.9% of the population; 95% confidence interval [CI], 932–1932 million [15.2%–31.5%]) in 2000 to 4758 million people (49.8% of the population; 95% CI, 3620–6056 million [43.4%–55.7%]) in 2050 (Fig 1). Similar growth was predicted for those with high myopia (≥–5.00 D or more myopia): from 163 million people (2.7% of the population; 95% CI, 86–387 million [1.4%–6.3%]) to 938 million people (9.8% of the population; 95% CI, 479–2104 million [5.7%–19.4%]).

Although the vision loss resulting from refractive error can usually be addressed with spectacles or contact lenses, the anatomic changes (i.e., longer ocular axial length) associated with myopia increase a patient’s risk of unretractable visual impairment developing throughout life, especially with advanced age. Higher degrees of myopia are associated with greater risks for complications and subsequent vision loss. By 75 years of age, 3.8% of those with myopia (0.50 to –6.00 D myopia) and 39% of those with high myopia (–6.00 D or more myopia) among Dutch individuals have uncorrectable visual impairment. Myopia increases the risk of retinal detachment, cataract, glaucoma, staphyloma, myopic macular degeneration, and myopic choroidal neovascularization. It is projected that uncorrectable visual impairment resulting from myopia will increase 7 to 13 times in high-risk areas by 2055. The public health burden posed by myopia extends beyond the direct costs associated with the optical correction of refractive error and includes the socioeconomic impacts and diminished quality of life associated with visual impairment. The increasing prevalence of myopia and corresponding clinical and societal impacts necessitate a coordinated global response.

In February 2019, in recognition of this public health concern, the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s Board of Trustees determined that the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) would take a leading role in addressing the need to combat the development and progression of myopia on a global basis. As a first step, the Board of Trustees created the Task Force on Myopia comprising experts in myopia from around the world to develop an evidence-based white paper on the rationale for early intervention, including approaches to control myopia progression and to outline next steps to address this public health problem. The Task Force was organized in the spring.

Of 2019, reviewed the scientific literature over the summer of 2019, met in person in October 2019, and held subsequent online discussions and idea exchanges throughout the spring of 2020. The primary aim of the Task Force was to explore how the Academy could serve best as a resource to slow the development and progression of myopia. The Task Force’s intent for this report is not to duplicate recent rigorous scientific reviews of the genetics, prevalence, economics costs, and epidemiologic features of myopia or of the effectiveness and safety of various interventions for reducing myopia progression. Instead, the goals of the Task Force are to provide a broad-based overview of the current scientific evidence and focus on the initiation and support of public health interventions that address this important issue in a thoughtful, concerted, and systematic manner.

The goal of the Task Force’s recommendations is to reduce the global burden of myopia by delaying the onset of myopia and reducing myopia progression in children and adolescents, with the hopes of preventing the more severe consequences of higher levels of myopia. The objectives of the Task Force are to help define the role of the Academy in addressing this important public health problem by:

1. Educating the health care community, public policy makers, and the general public about the public health burden imposed by myopia.
2. Assisting in the development of broad public health initiatives to prevent the onset and progression of myopia, including working with parents and educational authorities to create school-based programs that incorporate and maintain educational standards while leveraging the benefit of outdoor time.
3. Fostering collaboration among researchers, health care organizations, and industry internationally to develop novel interventions for myopia control.

### Epidemiology of Myopia and Future Trends Globally

#### Risk Factors for Myopia  
Myopia is a multifactorial condition with both genetic and environmental components. The increasing prevalence of myopia points toward environmental influences such as the role of urbanization and reduced outdoor exposure as keys to myopia development. Certain populations, especially within East Asia, seem particularly at risk of myopia.  

The marked rise in myopia prevalence in East Asia seems to be driven primarily by more severe environmental exposures (e.g., high educational pressures combined with less outdoor time).[^7–^10] Several risk factors for myopia have been studied, including gender, race and ethnicity, outdoor time, near-work activity, socioeconomic status, education level, body mass index, exercise and activity level, and diet, with varying degrees of supporting evidence.[^12]

Studies examining the role of near work in myopia onset and progression have produced inconsistent results, whereas the relationship between increased outdoor time and reduced myopia onset is established more firmly.[^12–^14] An association between myopia and education has long been observed anecdotally, with supporting observational studies.[^15–^20] The bidirectional, 2-sample Mendelian randomization study by Mountjoy et al[^16] provided strong causal evidence that exposure to more years of education contributes to a rise.

## Epidemiologic Features of Myopia in the United States

Epidemiologic studies typically define myopia as a spherical equivalent of at least −0.50 D and high myopia as a spherical equivalent of at least −5.00 D or −6.00 D; however, it is important to note that studies that use noncycloplegic refractions overestimated the degree of myopia, especially in children and young adults. 

Data from the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggested that 44.7% of American adults older than 20 years of age were myopic (defined as at least −0.50 D), with 6.5% being highly myopic (defined as at least −5.00 D). Comparison of the 1971–1972 and 1999–2004 NHANES data indicated that the prevalence of myopia increased in people between 12 and 54 years of age during the period between the two surveys (25.0% vs. 41.6%; P < 0.001). Although the overall prevalence and degree of myopia were likely overestimated in this analysis, the same methodology was used in both cohorts. Willis et al. more recent analyses of the NHANES (2005–2008) and the Intelligent Research in Sight Registry estimated that 3.92% of American adults had high myopia. 

Theophanous et al. provided contemporary estimates of myopia in a Southern California cohort of children 5 to 19 years of age that was broadly representative of the state’s demographics. They reported that 41.9% of patients 19 years of age or younger were myopic (at least −1.00 D) and 2.7% of patients demonstrated high myopia (at least −6.00 D). However, because these values are derived from children undergoing routine eye examinations, they are likely higher than the general population. Myopia was more common among Asian and Pacific Islander children (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.58–1.70) and Black children (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03–1.13) compared with White children. 

The prevalence of myopia (at least −1.00 D) in children between 6 and 72 months of age, based on cycloplegic autorefraction, among children in Los Angeles was shown to vary based on race, with the highest rates seen in Black children (6.6%), followed by Asian children (3.98%), Hispanic children (3.7%), and non-Hispanic White children (1.20%). The parallel study in Baltimore for children 6 to 72 months of age found higher myopia rates in Black children (5.5%) compared with non-Hispanic White children (0.7%). Among American school-aged children, Asian Americans were found to have the highest prevalence of myopia based on cycloplegic autorefraction in 2003: 18.5% compared with 13.2% in Hispanic children, 6.6% in Black children, and 4.4% in White children. However, the lack of large-scale nationwide cycloplegic data, especially among teenagers, limits our understanding of the true prevalence rates in American children. Read et al. found that among recent enlistees in the United States Air Force (69% men; mean age, 20.59 years), 45% were myopic (more than −0.50 D) and 2% demonstrated high myopia (more than −6.00 D).  

## Epidemiologic Features of Myopia Globally

A 2004 meta-analysis estimated that the crude prevalence of myopia (at least −1.00 D) among adults older than 40 years of age in Western Europe and Australia was 26.6% and 16.4%, with 4.6% and 2.8% having high myopia (at least −5.00 D), respectively. This compared similarly with American adults who showed estimated myopia and high myopia prevalences of 25.4% and 4.5%, respectively. 

The European Eye Epidemiology Consortium estimated the prevalence of myopia in an ethnically homogenous adult cohort (≥25 and <90 years of age) in which 98% of individuals had European ancestry. Myopia (at least −0.75 D) and high myopia (at least −6.00 D) were present in 30.6% (95% CI, 30.4%–30.9%) and 2.7% (95% CI, 2.69%–2.73%) of adult Europeans, respectively. A 2019 review of the literature from India estimated that myopia prevalence in young adults between 16 to 25 years of age was 22.7% based on cycloplegic refraction.

## Importance of Myopia and Consequences of High Myopia Globally

### Clinical Impact of Myopia

Refractive errors resulting from myopia can usually be corrected with spectacles or contact lenses, although achieving satisfactory vision becomes more challenging with higher degrees of myopia. Anatomic changes in eyes in patients with myopia (i.e., longer axial length) increase the risk of secondary ocular sequelae, which can ultimately lead to uncorrectable visual impairment. Results from the Blue Mountains Eye Study demonstrated an increased risk of cataract and glaucoma in myopic patients. The Eye Disease Case-Control Study Group demonstrated that eyes with −1.00 to −3.00 D refractive error had a 4 times increased risk of idiopathic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, whereas eyes with more than −3.00 D of myopia had a 10 times increased risk compared with non-myopic eyes. Of note, eyes with pathologic myopia were excluded from this study, which may have resulted in an underestimation of retinal detachment risk, especially in those with higher degrees of myopia.

Individuals with myopia, especially those with high myopia, can experience vision loss resulting from degenerative macular changes owing to progressive axial elongation of the globe with resultant chorioretinal atrophy at least as severe as in age-related atrophy. These changes have been referred to as pathologic myopia, myopic degeneration, degenerative myopia, or myopic maculopathy and have a reported prevalence of 0.96% to 3.1%. Among Chinese adults 21 years of age and older, a 1-mm increase in axial length conferred a 1.084% higher risk of pathologic myopic retinopathy as well as a 7.35% higher risk of low vision. Pathologic myopia is an important cause of low vision and blindness, especially in East Asia, where it is responsible for 12.2% to 31.25% of cases of low vision and was ranked as the most frequent cause of blindness in one Chinese study (19.4%).

The Rotterdam Study found that myopic degeneration was the most common cause of visual impairment (25%) among those younger than 75 years of age in The Netherlands. Myopic maculopathy was the cause of blindness in 6.0% to 9.1% of people in predominantly White countries, making it the second- to fifth-most common cause of blindness in these populations. When considering blindness on a person-person basis, myopic degeneration was the third-most common cause in the US.

## Socioeconomic Impact of Myopia

The socioeconomic impact of myopia is multifactorial and involves the direct costs of refractive correction as well as the indirect costs of lost economic opportunity for those affected and their caregivers. Additionally, costs are associated with expanding ophthalmic infrastructure to accommodate the medical needs of myopic patients (e.g., more trained eye care providers, more clinics). The regional economic impact of myopia varies based on health care resources and use as well as labor force participation, employment patterns, myopia prevalence (including severity), and predominant economic industries and activities. 

Data from the 1999–2002 NHANES suggest that refractive correction results in normal vision in more than 110 million Americans 12 years of age and older and that it would cost at least $3.8 billion to correct impaired distance vision. Globally, it has been estimated that visual impairment resulting from uncorrected myopia results in $244 billion worth of loss of productivity (95% CI, $49 billion–$697 billion) and that blindness resulting from myopic macular degeneration results in a $6 billion dollar productivity loss (95% CI, $2 billion–$17 billion). The greatest losses in productivity resulting from uncorrected myopia, as a percentage of gross domestic product, are estimated to occur in Southeast Asia (1.35%), South Asia (1.30%), and East Asia (1.27%).

It was estimated in 2012 that a 5-year investment of $20 billion would address visual impairment resulting from all forms of uncorrected refractive error. The potential productivity gains from correcting myopia far outweigh the costs, making it a wise global economic investment for both the public and private sectors. Considering the increasing prevalence trends in myopia, further economic benefits are likely to be realized from reducing the prevalence of myopia globally as well as decreasing the progression of myopia, with a particular focus on reducing the risk of pathologic myopia.

## Myopia Control Strategies

Optical, pharmacologic, and behavioral interventions have been attempted for myopia control. Spectacle- and soft contact lens-based approaches that provide myopic defocus of light on the peripheral retina have been used with modest treatment effects. Overnight orthokeratology (OOK) reshapes the cornea and allows users to go without their myopic correction during the day. In addition to correcting low to moderate degrees of myopia, myopic progression is reduced, presumably from the induction of myopic defocus on the peripheral retina, which reduces the stimulus for axial length growth. 

A 2019 AAO Ophthalmic Technology Assessment found that safety remains an important concern because of the risk of potentially blinding microbial keratitis resulting from contact lens wear and because clinical differences are small with other viable and lower-cost interventions. Daily disposable soft bifocal and multifocal contact lenses require less professional expertise and oversight than are required for OOK lens treatment, and they possess similar efficacy in slowing myopia progression.

A randomized clinical trial found reduced 3-year myopia progression in children who used high add power soft multifocal contact lenses (~0.60 D) compared with children who used medium add power (−0.89 D) or single-vision (−1.05 D) contact lenses. Postmarket experience with a multifocal soft lens approved for myopia control in the United States in 2019 and other similar lenses should provide informative.

Early studies of topical atropine demonstrated that high doses (0.5%–1%) were effective in slowing myopia progression; however, their practical usefulness was limited by photophobia and glare resulting from pupillary dilation and reduced accommodation. Subsequent studies demonstrated moderate reductions in myopic progression from lower doses of atropine (0.01%–0.1%). A 2017 AAO Ophthalmic Technology Assessment concluded that although the treatment effect was not as large as that found using higher doses of atropine, a lower dose of atropine (0.01%) resulted in fewer side effects and less rebound myopia after cessation, making it the most reasonable approach to myopia control. 

In a meta-analysis of 16 atropine clinical control interventions, Huang et al found that atropine was the most effective treatment method for reducing myopia progression as measured by refraction. Yam et al compared low-dose concentrations of atropine (0.05%, 0.025%, and 0.01%) and found that the 2-year efficacy of 0.05% atropine was twice that of 0.01% atropine.

A limitation of all myopia interventions is the lack of long-term follow-up and uncertainty about how different interventions affect myopia over time.

## Conclusions

Myopia is a growing public health problem that carries significant visual morbidity on an individual- and population-based level. The growth in myopia prevalence, especially in East Asia, paired with the projected international growth in myopia prevalence and its secondary complications, are a cause for alarm. It is necessary to prioritize the development of effective interventions to stem the tide of the myopia epidemic. Creative and multidisciplinary problem solving that leverages the collaboration and expertise of eye care professionals, governmental agencies, school authorities, industry, family physicians, and pediatricians is necessary to address an international challenge of this magnitude.

In summary, the Academy’s proposed role will encompass the following next steps, which will need to be tempered by the urgency and resources needed to address the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The Appendix (available at [www.aaojournal.org](http://www.aaojournal.org)) outlines further public health approaches as well as the proposed role of the Academy in dealing with the myopic epidemic.

## Advocacy

The Academy will advocate in the United States and internationally to promote myopia as an important public health concern. This will involve collaboration with supranational organizations and regional public health agencies. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic will be a primary focus of public health organizations for the foreseeable future, and it is vital to ensure that the importance of myopia control, which requires a long-term perspective, remains a priority and is not overlooked. The Academy will advocate for appropriate patient access to methods to control myopia progression (e.g., effective pharmaceuticals and devices through appropriate regulatory approval processes and third-party payer policies). The Academy will also advocate for appropriate reimbursement for methods to slow myopia progression.

## Research

The Academy will seek to foster collaboration among researchers, health care organizations, and industry internationally to develop novel interventions for myopia control. The Academy will seek avenues to promote multicenter randomized controlled trials of medical and public health interventions. The Academy will also perform big data analyses from registries (e.g., the Intelligent Research in Sight Registry) and will encourage observational studies to identify risk factors for the progression of myopia. In addition, the Academy will seek to support strengthening the regulatory science for evaluating drugs and devices intended to slow myopia progression.

## Education

The Academy will seek to educate ophthalmologists, optometrists, the health care community, and public policy makers about the public health burden imposed by myopia. Educational resources for clinicians, nonclinical entities (e.g., governmental and school agencies), including the general public, and patients and their parents will be valuable to promote the importance of myopia as a public health problem and the value of slowing myopic progression. The Academy will serve as a resource for clinicians and organizations globally. The Academy will also strive to facilitate collaborative relationships among stakeholders for identifying novel approaches to myopia management and effective public health interventions and to advance the standardization of terminology to enhance the reporting of research findings.

## Public Health

The Academy will aid the development of public health initiatives to prevent the onset and slow the progression of myopia. The Academy will collaborate with other leading public health entities to design and implement these myopia control initiatives. The Academy will additionally promote activities with parents and educational authorities to create school-based programs that incorporate and maintain educational standards while leveraging the benefit of increased outdoor time. The Academy’s leadership and staff will work with pediatric and family physician organizations to communicate the value of outdoor time for children and encourage the screening and early diagnosis of children with myopia to maximize the benefit of myopia control interventions.
