## OBJECTIVES OF PREFERRED PRACTICE PATTERN GUIDELINES
As a service to its members and the public, the American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed a series of Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that identify characteristics and components of quality eye care. Appendix 1 describes the core criteria of quality eye care.
The Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are based on the best available scientific data as interpreted by committees of knowledgeable health professionals. In some instances, such as when results of carefully conducted clinical trials are available, the data are particularly persuasive and provide clear guidance. In other instances, the committees have to rely on their collective judgment and evaluation of available evidence.
**These documents provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular individual.** While they should generally meet the needs of most patients, they cannot possibly best meet the needs of all patients. Adherence to these PPPs will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation. These practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results. It may be necessary to approach different patients’ needs in different ways. The physician must make the ultimate judgment about the propriety of the care of a particular patient in light of all of the circumstances presented by that patient. The American Academy of Ophthalmology is available to assist members in resolving ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of ophthalmic practice.
**Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual situations.** The Academy specifically disclaims any and all liability for injury or other damages of any kind, from negligence or otherwise, for any and all claims that may arise out of the use of any recommendations or other information contained herein.
References to certain drugs, instruments, and other products are made for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to constitute an endorsement of such. Such material may include information on applications that are not considered community standard, that reflect indications not included in approved U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, or that are approved for use only in restricted research settings. The FDA has stated that it is the responsibility of the physician to determine the FDA status of each drug or device he or she wishes to use, and to use them with appropriate patient consent in compliance with applicable law.
Innovation in medicine is essential to ensure the future health of the American public, and the Academy encourages the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic methods that will improve eye care. It is essential to recognize that true medical excellence is achieved only when the patients’ needs are the foremost consideration.
All Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are reviewed by their parent committee annually or earlier if developments warrant and updated accordingly. To ensure that all PPPs are current, each is valid for 5 years from the approved by date unless superseded by a revision. Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are funded by the Academy without commercial support. Authors and reviewers of PPPs are volunteers and do not receive any financial compensation for their contributions to the documents. The PPPs are externally reviewed by experts and stakeholders, including consumer representatives, before publication. The PPPs are developed in compliance with the Council of Medical Specialty Societies’ Code for Interactions with Companies. The Academy has Relationship with Industry Procedures (available at [www.aao.org/about-preferred-practice-patterns](http://www.aao.org/about-preferred-practice-patterns)) to comply with the Code.
Appendix 2 contains the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes for the disease entities that this PPP covers. The intended users of the Posterior Vitreous Detachment, Retinal Breaks, and Lattice Degeneration PPP are ophthalmologists.
## METHODS AND KEY TO RATINGS
Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful information to practitioners. Where evidence exists to support a recommendation for care, the recommendation should be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence. To accomplish these aims, methods from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation² (GRADE) group are used. GRADE is a systematic approach to grading the strength of the total body of evidence that is available to support recommendations on a specific clinical management issue. Organizations that have adopted GRADE include SIGN, the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Policy, and the American College of Physicians.
- All studies used to form a recommendation for care are graded for strength of evidence individually, and that grade is listed with the study citation.
- To rate individual studies, a scale based on SIGN¹ is used. The definitions and levels of evidence to rate individual studies are as follows:
| Level     | Description                                                                                         |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I++       | High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias |
| I+        | Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias           |
| I-        | Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias                        |
| II++      | High-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies                                   |
|           | High-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal |
| II+       | Well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal |
| II-       | Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal |
| III       | Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series)                                              |
- Recommendations for care are formed based on the body of the evidence. The body of evidence quality ratings are defined by GRADE² as follows:
| Quality         | Description                                                                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Good quality     | Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect         |
| Moderate quality | Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate |
| Insufficient quality | Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Any estimate of effect is very uncertain |
- Key recommendations for care are defined by GRADE² as follows:
| Recommendation              | Description                                                                    |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strong recommendation        | Used when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects or clearly do not |
| Discretionary recommendation | Used when the trade-offs are less certain—either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced |
- The Highlighted Findings and Recommendations for Care section lists points determined by the Retina/Vitreous PPP Committee to be of particular importance to vision and quality of life outcomes.
- All recommendations for care in this PPP were rated using the system described above. Ratings are embedded throughout the PPP main text in italics.
- Literature searches to update the PPP were undertaken on March 6, 2023, January 23, 2024, and August 5, 2024 in PubMed. Complete details of the literature searches are available online at [www.aao.org/ppp](www.aao.org/ppp).
- Relevant systematic reviews were identified by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision US Satellite (CEV@US). These systematic reviews were screened by the committee and rated using the system described above by the committee methodologist.
- Recommendations are based on systematic reviews, as per the Institute of Medicine (Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust, 2011). In formulating the recommendations, the health benefits, side effects/harms/risks, and the balance of benefits and risks are reviewed and considered. Final decisions are arrived at through informal consensus techniques. If there are areas of disagreement, a vote will be conducted among the members of the guideline committee. If there are individuals with direct financial relationships in the area of disagreement, these individuals will refrain from the vote.
## HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARE
- Acute horseshoe retinal tears and traumatic breaks usually require treatment.
- Asymptomatic atrophic or operculated retinal breaks rarely need treatment. More generally, an eye that has atrophic round holes within lattice lesions has minimal subretinal fluid without progression or that lacks evidence of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) does not require treatment.
- An early diagnosis of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is important because the rate of successful retinal reattachment is higher and the visual results are better when repaired early, especially before the RRD involves the macula.
- Patients presenting with an acute PVD and no retinal breaks have a small chance (~2%) of developing retinal breaks in the weeks that follow. Patients with any degree of vitreous pigment, vitreous or retinal hemorrhage, or visible vitreoretinal traction upon indirect ophthalmoscopy should be asked to return for a second examination within 6 weeks or promptly if they have new symptoms.
- Between 5% and 14% of patients with symptomatic PVD found to have a retinal break at the time of the initial visit will develop additional breaks during long-term follow-up.
- Treatment of peripheral horseshoe tears should extend to the ora serrata if the tear cannot be surrounded using laser surgery or cryotherapy. The most common cause of failure is inadequate treatment, particularly along the anterior border (where visualization is more difficult).
## INTRODUCTION
### DISEASE DEFINITION
Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is a separation of the posterior vitreous cortex from the internal limiting membrane of the retina.⁴ (See Glossary.) This separation may be complete or partial. Vitreous traction at sites of significant vitreoretinal adhesion is responsible for most retinal breaks that lead to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). (See Glossary.) Retinal breaks are defined as full-thickness defects in the retina. Lattice retinal degeneration is a vitreoretinal degenerative process that predisposes to retinal tears and detachment. It is a peripheral vitreoretinal condition characterized by retinal thinning, overlying vitreous liquefaction, and firm vitreoretinal adhesions at the margins of thinning. Most lattice retinal degenerations are ovoid, with the long axes of lattice running parallel to the ora serrata. Perivascular lattice occurs radially and is typically found along the retinal vessels. Radial lattice is associated with a much higher risk of RRD than circumferential lattice. Round holes occur frequently within areas of lattice retinal degeneration. Vitreomacular traction (VMT) may develop when the vitreous partially separates from the macula, potentially leading to mechanical distortion of the macula that may correspond to visual symptoms.⁴ (See Glossary.)
### PATIENT POPULATION
Individuals may present with symptoms or signs suggestive of PVD, retinal breaks, vitreous hemorrhage, RRD, or VMT. A PVD typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 65 in the general population; however, the posterior vitreous may detach earlier in trauma and myopia.³ Other individuals may not be symptomatic and, based on clinical examination findings, may have an increased risk of RRD as the vitreous separates.
### CLINICAL OBJECTIVES
- Identify patients at risk of developing an RRD
- Examine symptomatic patients presenting with an acute PVD to detect and treat associated retinal breaks
- Recognize the evolution of retinal breaks and lattice retinal degeneration
- Manage patients at high risk of developing RRD
- Educate high-risk patients about symptoms of PVD, retinal breaks, and RRDs as well as the need for periodic follow-up
## BACKGROUND
### POSTERIOR VITREOUS DETACHMENT
Population-based studies that evaluate incidence and prevalence of PVD are difficult to conduct owing to the lack of definite clinical signs and unreliable clinical tests. A PVD typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 65 in the general population, with earlier onset in men than women; however, the posterior vitreous may detach earlier in trauma and myopia, or PVD may be precipitated by ophthalmic surgical procedures.⁵⁻⁸ Posterior vitreous detachment leads to vitreous traction at the vitreous base and in areas of lattice retinal degeneration, and thereby, secondarily, is thought to cause most symptomatic retinal breaks that may lead to an RRD.⁹ The symptoms of a PVD include light flashes (photopsias) and floaters (myodesopsias), and patients with such symptoms are at a higher risk for RRD.¹⁰⁻¹⁴ The stages of a PVD are described in Table 1.⁴ Patients typically report the light flashes characteristic of a PVD as being most noticeable in the dark. Such photopsias are likely the result of vitreous traction on the retina as the vitreous separates from the posterior retina toward the vitreous base. The floaters may be due to blood from a torn or avulsed retinal vessel, condensations of vitreous collagen, or the epipapillary glial tissue (Weiss ring) that is separated from the optic nerve head and area adjacent to the optic nerve head. The rate of retinal tears noted at the time of initial examination with acute PVD symptoms ranges from 5.4% to 8%.¹⁵,¹⁶ There is a direct correlation between the amount of vitreous hemorrhage and the likelihood of a retinal tear.¹⁷ Patients with an acute PVD who have no retinal breaks on presentation have a 2% chance of experiencing a detected (missed or new)
#### TABLE 1: Stages of Posterior Vitreous Detachment
| Stage | Description                                                                               |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stage 1 | Perifoveal separation with adhesion of vitreous to the fovea                              |
| Stage 2 | Complete separation of vitreous from the macula                                           |
| Stage 3 | Extensive vitreous separation with adhesion of vitreous to the disc                      |
| Stage 4 | Complete posterior vitreous detachment                                                   |
**Note:** These stages can be studied with optical coherence tomography.
**\*** The proposed staging levels may not imply a linear, staged progression of a posterior vitreous detachment.
Approximately 80% of patients who presented without detected breaks, and then had breaks occur subsequently, had either pigmented cells or hemorrhage in the vitreous or retina at the initial evaluation, or new symptoms that prompted a return visit to the ophthalmologist.
A spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage can be the presenting sign of PVD or may occur during the evolution of the PVD. Two-thirds of patients who present with associated vitreous hemorrhage were found to have at least one break. In this subgroup, one-third had more than one break and approximately 88% of the breaks occurred in the superior quadrants.
### Evolution of Retinal Breaks and Lattice Degeneration
Precursors to RRDs are PVD, asymptomatic retinal breaks, symptomatic retinal breaks, lattice retinal degeneration, and cystic and zonular traction tuft. (See Glossary.) Because spontaneous retinal reattachment is uncommon, nearly all patients with a symptomatic clinical RRD will progressively lose vision unless the detachment is repaired.
Currently, more than 95% of uncomplicated RRDs can be successfully repaired, although more than one procedure may be required. The prophylactic treatment of high-risk breaks usually prevents RRD. An early diagnosis of an RRD is also important because the rate of successful reattachment is higher, and the visual results are better when repaired early and especially before the RRD involves the macula.
The goal of RRD treatment is to allow patients to maintain or re-establish their abilities to read, work, drive, care for themselves, and maintain their quality of life.
### Asymptomatic Retinal Breaks
Asymptomatic operculated holes and atrophic round holes rarely lead to RRD. A 1998 study followed 46 asymptomatic eyes with operculated retinal breaks over an average of 11 years.
A 1974 study followed 28 eyes for up to 5 years in subjects where 80% of the fellow eyes had an RRD. All combined, none of the 74 eyes from these studies progressed to RRD during the follow-up period.
Eyes with signs and symptoms of acute PVD may have atrophic retinal breaks with clinical features of chronicity, such as pigment demarcation, suggesting that they are unrelated to the acute vitreoretinal traction from the PVD. Such breaks are considered to be pre-existing rather than symptomatic. Treatment may be considered for these breaks in certain situations, although the literature provides little guidance.
Randomized clinical trials are not available; therefore, there is limited evidence to support prophylactic therapy.
Approximately 5% of eyes with asymptomatic horseshoe tears progress to RRD. Horseshoe tears discovered in asymptomatic fellow eyes are less likely than symptomatic horseshoe tears to lead to clinical RRD (See Glossary).
### Symptomatic Retinal Breaks
A symptomatic retinal break is defined as a break caused by vitreoretinal traction in a patient typically with a PVD associated with new-onset flashes and/or floaters.
At least half of untreated symptomatic retinal breaks with persistent vitreoretinal traction (horseshoe or flap tear) lead to clinical RRD.
## Lattice Retinal Degeneration
Generally, treatment is not required for atrophic round holes within lattice lesions that are accompanied by minimal subretinal fluid without progression and no PVD. However, lattice retinal degeneration is a risk factor for developing an RRD. An RRD associated with lattice degeneration can develop either from round holes without PVD or tractional-related holes associated with PVD. Small asymptomatic peripheral RRDs occurring secondary to retinal holes in areas of lattice retinal degeneration are termed subclinical retinal detachments (see Glossary). Although these can enlarge and progress to clinical RRDs, they have been shown by observation alone to have a low likelihood of progression in most patients. Prophylactic or interventional treatment should be considered when the detachments are documented to become symptomatic, increase in size, or show other signs of progression.
One analysis studied 423 eyes with lattice retinal degeneration in 276 patients over a period averaging nearly 11 years. Of these, 150 eyes (35%) had atrophic holes in lattice, and 10 of these 150 eyes had subretinal fluid extending more than 1 disc diameter from the break (subclinical retinal detachment). Six other eyes developed new subclinical RRDs during follow-up. Clinical RRDs developed in 3 of the 423 eyes. Two were due to round retinal holes in lattice lesions of patients in their mid-20s, and one was due to a symptomatic tractional tear. These data indicate that patients with lattice retinal degeneration with or without round holes are at a very low risk for progression to clinical RRD without a previous RRD in the fellow eye. However, in eyes with RRD in one eye, one study found benefit in prophylactic laser treatment of the other eye.
More commonly, RRD occurs in eyes with lattice retinal degeneration when a PVD induces a horseshoe tear. Such tears should be treated using either laser demarcation or cryotherapy.
## Incidence of Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment
The annual incidence of RRD is approximately 10 to 18 per 100,000 persons. Of these, 20% to 40% have had cataract surgery and 10% have had ocular trauma. In a study from the Netherlands, the annual RRD incidence was 18 per 100,000 people, with a peak incidence of 35 per 100,000 people between 55 and 59 years of age. Prior cataract surgery was reported in 34% of RRD eyes. Germany has reported an increase in the annual incidence of RRD from 2005 to 2021, with an adjusted incidence rising from 15.6 per 100,000 in 2005 to 24.8 in 2021, particularly among males, and with possibly increasing diagnoses at slightly younger ages (60.2–62 years versus 62–63 years).
## Risk Factors for Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment
Aside from retinal breaks, risk factors for RRD include myopia, lattice retinal degeneration, cataract or other intraocular surgery, neodymium yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy surgery including YAG capsulotomy and vitreolysis, trauma, use of miotic eye drops, a history of RRD in the other eye, certain genetic disorders such as Stickler syndrome, or history of RRD in a first-degree relative. Combinations of these factors may increase the risk.
### Myopia
According to one study, more than half of nontraumatic RRDs occur in myopic eyes. As axial length increases, the risk of RRD increases proportionately. This study found that individuals with low myopia (1–3 diopters) have a fourfold risk of RRD whereas if the risk of RRD was 10-fold if the refractive error was greater than -3 diopters. Individuals with higher levels of myopia have higher risks compared with nonmyopic individuals.
### Lattice Retinal Degeneration
Lattice retinal degeneration is present in 6% to 8% of the population and increases the risk of RRD. Approximately 20% to 30% of patients with RRD have lattice retinal degeneration.
Perivascular or radial lattice is associated with a higher risk of retinal tear or detachment.
Perivascular lattice is also frequently seen in Stickler syndrome.
### Cataract Surgery
Prior studies (before modern-day small incision-cataract surgery) have reported the average overall risk of RRD after cataract surgery to be approximately 1%. Recent data using the IRIS registry with over 3 million U.S. cataract operations from 2014 to 2017 found the incidence of RRD within 1 year of cataract surgery to be 0.21%, or approximately 1 in 500 cataract surgeries. This information is in line with other more recent studies showing a decline in the RRD incidence following cataract surgery.
The following conditions have been reported to increase the risk of RRD after cataract surgery: axial myopia, pre-existing vitreoretinal disease, male gender, younger age, vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber, and spontaneous extension of the capsulotomy at the time of surgery. In the IRIS registry study, the presence of hypermature cataract and the use of the complex cataract surgery CPT code were associated with an increased risk of RRD. One study suggests that in the absence of a posterior capsular tear at the time of cataract surgery, subsequent Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy may not increase the risk of RRD. Other studies suggest that Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy is associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of RRD, especially in myopic patients.
Outside of complications at the time of surgery, RRD after cataract surgery usually occurs 1 to 2 years later. A 5-year study using B-scan ultrasonography reported that onset of a PVD was the major risk factor for RRD (not the presence or absence of lattice) after cataract surgery and that if a pre-existing PVD was not present prior to cataract surgery, most patients developed one at a median of 7 months after surgery. Consequently, one can extrapolate that it is the absence of a PVD (in higher risk eyes such as those with myopia and lattice) at the time of cataract surgery that poses a higher risk for RRD later.
### Trauma
Patients with blunt or penetrating ocular injuries that have altered the structure of the vitreous or retina are at increased risk of RRD. Vitreoretinal interface changes caused by trauma may be detected at the time of injury or many years later.
### Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment in the Fellow Eye
Patients with a history of nontraumatic RRD in one eye have an approximately 10% risk of developing RRD in the fellow eye, since pathologic vitreoretinal changes are frequently bilateral. The fellow eye in a patient with pseudophakic retinal detachment is also at higher risk of developing an RRD, whether the fellow eye is phakic or pseudophakic. Phakic fellow eyes in patients with pseudophakic retinal detachment have a 7% risk of RRD, suggesting that the risk of developing RRD should not be attributed to cataract surgery alone.
### Other Risk Factors
Other RRD risk factors that have been reported include prior retinopathy of prematurity and Stickler syndrome.
There are case reports of RRD in patients who have had keratorefractive surgery; however, large studies have not shown an increased risk in patients when compared with eyes of a similar refractive error. It remains possible that the risk of vitreoretinal pathology is different among particular keratorefractive techniques. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment following refractive lens exchange in patients with high myopia showed a cumulative increase from 2% to 8% over a 7-year period. Phakic intraocular lenses have not been associated with an increased risk of RRD compared with other intraocular interventions in highly myopic patients.
Medications, specifically miotic eyedrops, are associated with a higher risk of RRD. Case reports have described RRD in patients who received pilocarpine hydrochloride 1.25% for the treatment of presbyopia. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment after intravitreal injection is rare, with a reported rate of 0.013%, or approximately 1 in 7500 injections.
## CARE PROCESS
### PATIENT OUTCOME CRITERIA
For management and treatment for PVD and RRD, the following outcomes are important:
- Prevention of visual loss and functional impairment
- Maintenance of quality of life
### DIAGNOSIS
The initial evaluation of a patient with risk factors for RRD or symptoms of a PVD involves detection of vitreous pigment cells or debris and includes a thorough peripheral examination to look for retinal tears or holes. It also includes all aspects of the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation, with particular attention to those aspects relevant to PVD, retinal breaks, and lattice retinal degeneration. The ophthalmologist should also consider other causes of vitreous cells or debris (e.g., infectious or non-infectious uveitis, neoplasia).
#### History
A patient history should include the following elements:
- Symptoms of PVD
- Family history of RRD, genetic disorders (e.g., Stickler syndrome)
- Prior ocular trauma
- History of myopia
- History of ocular surgery, including refractive lens exchange and cataract surgery
- History of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy
- History of an intravitreal injection
#### Ophthalmic Examination
The eye examination should include the following elements:
- Visual acuity testing
- Confrontation visual field examination
- Pupillary assessment for the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect
- Examination of the vitreous for hemorrhage, detachment, and pigmented cells
- Careful examination of the peripheral fundus using scleral depression (see Table 3)
There are no symptoms that can reliably distinguish between a PVD with or without an associated retinal break; therefore, a peripheral retinal examination is required. The preferred method of evaluating patients for peripheral vitreoretinal pathology is to use an indirect ophthalmoscope combined with scleral depression. Many patients with retinal tears have blood and pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous. In fully dilated eyes, slit-lamp biomicroscopy with a mirrored contact lens or a condensing lens is an alternative method instead of a scleral depressed indirect examination of the peripheral retina. In many cases that are more challenging to examine, such as in patients who have considerable photosensitivity or media opacities, it is best to do both scleral depression and contact lens examination. The scleral depressed examination is a dynamic examination while a contact lens examination is a static examination.
#### Diagnostic Tests
Optical coherence tomography may be helpful to evaluate and stage the PVD. If media opacity or patient cooperation precludes an adequate examination of the peripheral retina, B-scan ultrasonography should be performed to search for retinal tears, RRD, mass lesions, or other causes of media opacity. Bilateral patching and/or elevation of the head while sleeping may aid in settling the vitreous hemorrhage. If no abnormalities are found, frequent follow-up examinations are recommended (i.e., every 1–2 weeks initially). Wide-field color photography
## MANAGEMENT
### Prevention
There are no effective methods of preventing the vitreous syneresis and liquefaction that lead to a PVD and possibly an RRD. For factors associated with an increased risk of RRD are discovered during a routine eye examination in an asymptomatic patient, a careful peripheral fundus examination is recommended. Patients at high risk should also be educated about the symptoms of PVD and RRD as well as about the value of periodic follow-up examinations.
Patients with retinal or vitreous hemorrhage have an increased risk of multiple retinal tears. A systematic review performed in 2012 found that there is no strong evidence to support or refute the use of 360-degree laser surgery intervention in the fellow eyes of patients with a unilateral giant retinal tear. One study reported that in Stickler syndrome over an average of 6.1 years of follow-up, only 9% of eyes with prophylactic 360° laser had a retinal detachment versus 23% of eyes that did not have prophylactic laser. In genetically verified Sticklers syndrome, 360 degree laser prophylaxis is now recommended.
### Surgical Management
It is essential that clinical personnel be familiar with the symptoms of PVD and RRD and that they recognize the need for urgent ophthalmologic evaluation of symptomatic patients.
Patients with symptoms of possible or suspected PVD or RRD and related disorders should be examined as soon as is feasible by an ophthalmologist skilled in binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy and supplementary techniques. Patients with retinal breaks or detachments should be treated by an ophthalmologist with experience in the management of these conditions. A Cochrane systematic review and subsequent updated review found low to very low certainty evidence indicating little or no difference between pars plana vitrectomy and scleral buckling in anatomical and visual acuity outcomes for repair of RRD.
*(106: I-, Insufficient quality; 107: I-, Insufficient quality)*
A meta-analysis also found no significant differences in visual acuity and final reattachment rates between pars plana vitrectomy and scleral buckling.
*(III, Moderate quality)*
One meta-analysis across 18 randomized controlled trials and 2,751 eyes found that scleral buckling had better early postoperative VA compared to pars plana vitrectomy, but there was no difference for primary reattachment, and combination surgery did not have significant differences compared to pars plana vitrectomy alone.
*(I-, Moderate quality)*
A large, multicenter, retrospective cohort study compared scleral buckle and pars plana vitrectomy for moderately complex phakic primary RRDs and reported that both scleral buckle and combination pars plana vitrectomy with scleral buckle were superior to vitrectomy in achieving single-surgery anatomic success. For macula-on or split cases, sclera buckle had significantly better visual outcomes than pars plana vitrectomy or sclera buckling with pars plana vitrectomy even after controlling for cataract.
Early vitrectomy (usually defined as within 7 days of presentation) for dense PVD-associated vitreous hemorrhage has been reported to have a low rate of complications and may be considered to reduce the risk of vision loss occurring secondary to macula-involving RRD. Prompt intervention is indicated if there is a tear seen on ultrasonography and the vitreous cavity precludes a view.
Posterior vitreous detachment symptoms (e.g., flashes and floaters) usually diminish over time, sometimes requiring several months. Appropriate reassurance and precautions regarding the symptoms of RRD should be given. However, some patients may be debilitated even in the absence of tears or detachments in the retina. The impact of floaters or floater-related visual symptoms may have an adverse effect on a person’s vision-related quality of life. Pars plana vitrectomy is an option if symptomatic floaters are still bothersome after several months. In fact, it has been documented that patients with a PVD have a significant reduction in contrast sensitivity function. Laser surgeries and pharmacotherapies have been proposed to decrease these symptoms; however, such therapies currently lack sufficient evidence to support their use. Pars plana vitrectomy has been used for removal of floaters, and post-operative improvement in contrast sensitivity function has been documented. In a review of series that compared pars plana vitrectomy and Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis surgery for floaters, pars plana vitrectomy showed evidence of greater patient satisfaction compared with only moderate improvement of symptoms following the Nd:YAG laser surgery. Another study found Nd:YAG vitreolysis to yield greater improvement in symptoms than sham laser surgery.
The goal of treatment for retinal breaks is to create a chorioretinal adhesion in the attached retina immediately adjacent to and surrounding the retinal tear using cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation surgery to halt the progression of subretinal fluid from detaching additional neurosensory retina.
Treatment of peripheral horseshoe tears should be extended to the ora serrata if the tear cannot be surrounded using laser surgery or cryotherapy. The most common cause of failure in treating horseshoe tears is failure to adequately treat the tear, particularly at the anterior border. Continued vitreous traction may extend the tear beyond the treated area and allow fluid to dissect through the subretinal space to cause a clinical RRD. Treatment of dialyses must extend over the entire length of the dialysis, reaching the ora serrata beyond each horn or end of the dialysis.
Sufficient evidence exists to warrant treating acute, symptomatic horseshoe tears. There is insufficient evidence for treatment of other vitreoretinal abnormalities. A Cochrane systematic review in 2014 found that in making the decision to treat other vitreoretinal abnormalities, including lattice retinal degeneration and asymptomatic retinal breaks, the risks that treatment would be unnecessary, ineffective, or harmful must be weighed against the possible benefit of reducing the rate of subsequent RRD (**+**, *Good quality, Strong recommendation*). This review showed that no randomized clinical trials have been performed to support treatment of asymptomatic retinal breaks with lattice degeneration. There is also no level 1 evidence to support the use of prophylactic laser surgery to areas of lattice retinal degeneration prior to anterior segment surgery. A consecutive case series involving 146 patients receiving prophylactic treatment of lattice degeneration in the fellow eye compared to 352 patients without prophylactic treatment found reduced incidence of retinal tear and retinal detachment over 5 years, but a prospective trial is necessary to confirm the effectiveness of laser prophylaxis in fellow eyes. A primary limitation of prophylactic therapy is that causative breaks leading to RRD often occur during a PVD in areas that appear normal prior to the PVD.
Table 2 summarizes recommendations for management of vitreoretinal lesions and abnormalities.

**PVD** = posterior vitreous detachment; **RRD** = rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
\* There is insufficient evidence to recommend prophylaxis of asymptomatic retinal breaks for patients undergoing cataract surgery.
The surgeon should inform the patient of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery. The treating surgeon is responsible for formulating a postoperative care plan and should inform the patient of these arrangements.¹²¹ ˒ ¹²²
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments may occur in spite of appropriate therapy. Traction is an important component and may pull the tear from the treated area, especially when there are larger breaks or bridging retinal blood vessels. The laser surgery- or cryotherapy-induced treatment adhesion (chorioretinal scar) may not be formed or complete for up to 1 month following treatment.³³ ˒ ³⁵ ˒ ¹¹⁹ Furthermore, 10% to 16% of patients will develop additional breaks during long-term follow-up.³⁵ ˒ ¹²³ ˒ ¹²⁴ Pseudophakic patients are more likely to require retreatment or to develop new breaks.³⁵
### Complications of Treatment
Proliferation of an epiretinal membrane (ERM), or macular pucker, has occasionally been observed following treatment for a retinal tear by either laser surgery or cryotherapy; however, a direct cause and effect relationship of treatment for a retinal break to ERM remains unclear, because an ERM may also occur spontaneously following the PVD with or without a retinal break. In one long-term follow-up study, the percentage of eyes that developed macular pucker after treatment of retinal breaks was no greater than the percentage of eyes observed to have macular pucker before treatment.³³ Therefore, the method of creating a chorioretinal adhesion may be unrelated to the incidence of postoperative macular pucker.¹²⁵ For complications of pars plana vitrectomy, see the Idiopathic Epiretinal Membrane and Vitreomacular Traction PPP.¹²⁶
### Follow-up Evaluation
The guidelines in Table 3 are recommendations for the timing of re-evaluation in the absence of additional symptoms. Patients with new symptoms or a change in symptoms may require more frequent evaluation. Patients with no positive findings at the initial examination should be seen at the intervals recommended in the Comprehensive Adult Medical Eye Evaluation PPP.⁸⁷ All patients with risk factors should be advised to contact their ophthalmologist promptly if new symptoms such as flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, or decreased visual acuity develop.⁴⁵ ˒ ⁴⁶ ˒ ⁸⁹ ˒ ¹²⁷ ˒ ¹²⁸

_PVD = posterior vitreous detachment; RRD = rhegmatogenous retinal detachment_
Myopic patients who have lattice retinal degeneration with holes need regular follow-up visits to monitor for subclinical RRDs that may slowly enlarge to become clinical RRDs. Treatment should be considered if the detachments progress in size.⁵⁹, ⁴⁰
Patients presenting with an acute symptomatic PVD and no retinal breaks have a small chance (approximately 2%) of developing retinal breaks in the weeks that follow.¹³ Thus, select patients, particularly those with any degree of vitreous pigment, vitreous or retinal hemorrhage, or visible vitreoretinal traction, should be asked to return for a second examination within 6 weeks following the onset of symptoms.¹³, ¹²⁴
### History at Follow-up Encounter
A patient history should include the following:
- Changes in visual symptoms¹⁰–¹⁴, ⁹³
- Interval history of eye trauma, intraocular injection, or intraocular surgery⁴⁶, ⁷¹
### Ophthalmic Examination
The eye examination should emphasize the following elements:
- Measurement of visual acuity
- **Evaluation of the vitreous status**, with attention to the presence of pigment, hemorrhage, or syneresis.¹⁰ ¹⁴ ¹⁶ ⁹³
- **Examination of the peripheral fundus** using scleral depression⁹⁴ or a fundus contact or non-contact lens using the slit-lamp biomicroscope.
- **Wide-field photography** may be helpful but does not replace careful ophthalmoscopy.
- **Optical coherence tomography** if VMT is present⁴ ²⁰ ⁹⁶ and to document presence of a developing PVD¹²⁹.
- **B-scan ultrasonography** when the media are opaque⁹⁷.
If the chorioretinal adhesion appears satisfactory at the first follow-up visit after treatment at 1 to 2 weeks, indirect ophthalmoscopy and scleral depression at 2 to 6 weeks will determine the adequacy of the chorioretinal scar, especially around the anterior boundary of the tear. If the tear and the accompanying subretinal fluid are not completely surrounded by the chorioretinal scar, additional treatment should be administered. At any postoperative visit, additional treatment should be considered if subretinal fluid has accumulated beyond the edge of treatment.³³ ³⁵
Even when a patient has had adequate treatment, additional examinations are important. Between 5% and 14% of patients found to have an initial retinal break will develop additional breaks during long-term follow-up. These statistics appear to be similar regardless of how the initial breaks were treated.³⁵ ¹²³ New breaks may be particularly likely in eyes that have had cataract surgery.³⁵
## COUNSELING AND REFERRAL
All patients with a PVD should be instructed to notify their ophthalmologist as soon as possible if there is a substantial change in symptoms, such as an increase in floaters or flashing lights, loss of visual field, or decrease in visual acuity.⁴⁵ ⁴⁶ ⁸⁹ ¹²⁷ If patients are familiar with the symptoms of retinal tear detachment, they may be more likely to report promptly, thus improving the likelihood of successful treatment and subsequent visual outcome.²⁴ Patients who undergo refractive surgery to reduce myopia should be informed that they remain at risk of RRD despite reduction of their refractive error.
## SOCIOECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
Limited data exist on the socioeconomic impacts of PVD, retinal breaks, or lattice retinal degeneration. However, research on the impact of the symptoms of these conditions (e.g., vitreous floaters) has suggested that vitreous symptoms may have an unfavorable effect on a patient’s vision-related quality of life.¹³⁰ ¹³¹ While expeditious examination of all patients with symptomatic PVDs will have costs, this approach actually saves resources. Modeling costs using the 2017 Medicare conversion factor of acutely evaluating and treating a patient with a symptomatic PVD and in a facility/hospital (nonfacility/Ambulatory Surgery Center) was $65 to $190 ($25–$71) per patient and depended on whether one or 2 examinations were performed. The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved was $255 to $638/QALY ($100–$293/QALY). A net cost savings of $1,749 ($1,314) and improved utility resulted from treatment of a symptomatic horseshoe tear. Treatment of an asymptomatic horseshoe tear resulted in a cost of $2,981/QALY ($1,436/QALY). Treatment of asymptomatic lattice retinal degeneration in an eye in which the fellow eye had a history of RD resulted in a net cost savings of $4,414/QALY ($2,187/QALY). This paper concluded that evaluation and management of incident acute PVD offer a low cost and favorable cost-utility (low$/QALY) as a result of the minimization of the cost and morbidity associated with the development of RRD.¹³²
## APPENDIX 1. QUALITY OF OPHTHALMIC CARE CORE CRITERIA
_Providing quality care
is the physician’s foremost ethical obligation, and is
the basis of public trust in physicians._
**AMA Board of Trustees, 1986**
Quality ophthalmic care is provided in a manner and with the skill that is consistent with the best interests of the patient. The discussion that follows characterizes the core elements of such care.
The ophthalmologist is first and foremost a physician. As such, the ophthalmologist demonstrates compassion and concern for the individual and utilizes the science and art of medicine to help alleviate patient fear and suffering. The ophthalmologist strives to develop and maintain clinical skills at the highest feasible level, consistent with the needs of patients, through training and continuing education. The ophthalmologist evaluates those skills and medical knowledge in relation to the needs of the patient and responds accordingly. The ophthalmologist also ensures that needy patients receive necessary care directly or through referral to appropriate persons and facilities that will provide such care, and he or she supports activities that promote health and prevent disease and disability.
The ophthalmologist recognizes that disease places patients in a disadvantaged, dependent state. The ophthalmologist respects the dignity and integrity of his or her patients and does not exploit their vulnerability.
Quality ophthalmic care has the following optimal attributes, among others.
- **The essence of quality care** is a meaningful partnership relationship between patient and physician. The ophthalmologist strives to communicate effectively with his or her patients, listening carefully to their needs and concerns. In turn, the ophthalmologist educates his or her patients about the nature and prognosis of their condition and about proper and appropriate therapeutic modalities. This is to ensure their meaningful participation (appropriate to their unique physical, intellectual, and emotional state) in decisions affecting their management and care, to improve their motivation and compliance with the agreed plan of treatment, and to help alleviate their fears and concerns.
- The ophthalmologist uses his or her best judgment in choosing and timing appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic modalities as well as the frequency of evaluation and follow-up, with due regard to the urgency and nature of the patient’s condition and unique needs and desires.
- The ophthalmologist carries out only those procedures for which he or she is adequately trained, experienced, and competent, or, when necessary, is assisted by someone who is, depending on the urgency of the problem and availability and accessibility of alternative providers.
- Patients are assured access to, and continuity of, needed and appropriate ophthalmic care, which can be described as follows.
    - The ophthalmologist treats patients with due regard to timeliness, appropriateness, and his or her own ability to provide such care.
    - The operating ophthalmologist makes adequate provision for appropriate pre- and postoperative patient care.
    - When the ophthalmologist is unavailable for his or her patient, he or she provides appropriate alternate ophthalmic care, with adequate mechanisms for informing patients of the existence of such care and procedures for obtaining it.
    - The ophthalmologist refers patients to other ophthalmologists and eye care providers based on the timeliness and appropriateness of such referral, the patient’s needs, the competence and qualifications of the person to whom the referral is made, and access and availability.
- The ophthalmologist seeks appropriate consultation with due regard to the nature of the ocular or other medical or surgical problem. Consultants are suggested for their skill, competence, and accessibility. They receive as complete and accurate an accounting of the problem as necessary to provide efficient and effective advice or intervention, and in turn they respond in an adequate and timely manner. The ophthalmologist maintains complete and accurate medical records.
- On appropriate request, the ophthalmologist provides a full and accurate rendering of the patient's records in his or her possession.
- The ophthalmologist reviews the results of consultations and laboratory tests in a timely and effective manner and takes appropriate actions.
- The ophthalmologist and those who assist in providing care identify themselves and their profession.
- For patients whose conditions fail to respond to treatment and for whom further treatment is unavailable, the ophthalmologist provides proper professional support, counseling, rehabilitative and social services, and referral as appropriate and accessible.
- Prior to therapeutic or invasive diagnostic procedures, the ophthalmologist becomes appropriately conversant with the patient's condition by collecting pertinent historical information and performing relevant preoperative examinations. Additionally, he or she enables the patient to reach a fully informed decision by providing an accurate and truthful explanation of the diagnosis; the nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and probability of success of the proposed treatment and of alternative treatment; and the risks and benefits of no treatment.
- The ophthalmologist adopts new technology (e.g., drugs, devices, surgical techniques) in judicious fashion, appropriate to the cost and potential benefit relative to existing alternatives and to its demonstrated safety and efficacy.
- The ophthalmologist enhances the quality of care he or she provides by periodically reviewing and assessing his or her personal performance in relation to established standards, and by revising or altering his or her practices and techniques appropriately.
- The ophthalmologist improves ophthalmic care by communicating to colleagues, through appropriate professional channels, changes in techniques and technology that benefit patient care, and by informing colleagues of instances of unusual or unexpected rates of complications and problems related to new drugs, devices, or procedures.
- The ophthalmologist provides care in suitably staffed and equipped facilities adequate to deal with potential ocular and systemic complications requiring immediate attention.
- The ophthalmologist also provides ophthalmic care in a manner that is cost effective without unacceptably compromising accepted standards of quality.

### Additional Information for ICD-10 Codes:
- Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters. The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct. The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field. If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder "X" must be used to fill in the empty characters.
- For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available.
- When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit):
  - Right is always 1
  - Left is always 2
  - Bilateral is always 3
## Glossary
### Atrophic retinal breaks or holes
Full-thickness retinal defects, unrelated to vitreoretinal traction. These can occur within lattice lesions or in areas of the retina that appear otherwise normal.
### Clinical retinal detachment
A retinal detachment that either impairs a portion of the visual field or extends more than 2 disc diameters posterior to the equator.
### Cystic retinal tufts
Small congenital lesions of the peripheral retina. They are slightly elevated and usually whitish in color with variable surrounding pigmentation. They are firmly attached to the overlying vitreous cortex and are sometimes a cause of retinal tears following PVD.
### ERM (Epiretinal membrane)
See **Macular pucker**.
### Flap tear
A horseshoe tear.
### Horseshoe tear
A retinal tear caused by vitreoretinal traction on the retina. The tear is horseshoe shaped owing to a flap of torn tissue that remains attached to the detached vitreous gel.
### ICD-9
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Ninth Edition.
### ICD-10
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Edition.
### Lattice retinal degeneration
A peripheral vitreoretinal lesion characterized by retinal thinning, overlying vitreous liquefaction, and firm vitreoretinal adhesions at its margins. Most lesions are ovoid with long axes parallel to the ora serrata. Round holes frequently occur within the lattice lesion unassociated with PVD. If horseshoe tears are present, they are seen at the development of PVD and usually are observed at the margins of lattice lesions.
### Macular pucker
Distortion of the retina in the macular region due to proliferation and contraction of a fibrocellular membrane on the inner surface of the retina.
### Operculated retinal tear or break
A defect in the retina caused by vitreoretinal traction at the site of the lesion. The traction pulls a circular or oval piece of retinal tissue (the operculum) free from the retinal surface. If this occurs during PVD, all traction in the vicinity of the retinal break is usually eliminated.
### PVD (Posterior vitreous detachment)
A separation of the posterior vitreous cortex from the internal surface of the retina. This usually occurs as an acute event after substantial age-related liquefaction in the vitreous gel; the separation usually extends rapidly to the posterior margin of the vitreous base in all quadrants. Adhesions between the vitreous cortex and retina or retinal blood vessels may cause retinal breaks and/or vessel rupture. Vitreous hemorrhage and/or localized intraretinal hemorrhage may accompany this event. Posterior vitreous detachment is diagnosed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, which will usually show a prominent plane defining the posterior vitreous face. The presence of a glial annulus in the vitreous cavity (Weiss ring) is strong evidence of PVD.
### Retinal breaks
Full-thickness defects in the retina. Those caused by vitreoretinal traction are usually called tears. Those that are round and unassociated with vitreoretinal traction are usually called holes.
### Retinal dialysis
A specific type of crescentic peripheral retinal break at the ora serrata with the retina’s posterior edge remaining attached to the vitreous base, usually associated with trauma.
### RRD (Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment)
A separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium caused by fluid passing from the vitreous cavity into the subretinal space through a break in the retina (from Greek *rhegma,* “rent”).
### Round retinal hole
A round, full-thickness defect or break in the retina, unassociated with vitreoretinal traction.
### Stickler syndrome
The most common inherited vitreoretinal and systemic disorder associated with RRD. Ocular features include (1) high myopia; (2) retrolentival, transvitreal, and epiretinal membranes and strands; (3) chorioretinal pigment alterations; (4) lattice retinal degeneration, often with a perivascular component that extends posteriorly; and (5) various other abnormalities including glaucoma and cataract. Systemic
Features include a generalized skeletal dysplasia, often with a marfanoid habitus, flattened facies, high arched or cleft palate, hearing loss, and other extracranial skeletal anomalies, many of which can be very subtle. The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant, and a gene defect has been related to **COL2A1**.
### Subclinical Retinal Detachment
A retinal detachment that extends more than 1 disc diameter from the posterior edge of the retinal break, less than 2 disc diameters from the equator, and does not impair the field of vision.
### VMA (Vitreomacular Adhesion)
A firm attachment between the cortical vitreous and the inner surface of the retina. Condensed vitreous strands adhering to the retina may sometimes be visualized using biomicroscopy or indirect ophthalmoscopy and scleral depression. Traction of the vitreous on the retina during PVD may cause retinal breaks to occur at these sites.
### VMT (Vitreomacular Traction)
Partial vitreous separation from the retina resulting in mechanical distortion of the macula.
### Zonular Traction Retinal Tufts
Small congenital lesions of the peripheral retina caused by thickened zonules that have been displaced posteriorly to the anterior retina.
## LITERATURE SEARCHES FOR THIS PPP
Literature searches of the PubMed database were conducted on March 6, 2023; the search strategies are listed below. Specific limited update searches were conducted on January 23, 2024 and August 5, 2024. The searches had added filters for human, English-language randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews and date limiters to capture literature published since June 1, 2019. The Retina/Vitreous PPP Committee analyzed 640 studies of which 18 were included in the PPP. The literature search emphasizes the disease condition and the search terms patient values and patient preferences yielded 75 studies.
