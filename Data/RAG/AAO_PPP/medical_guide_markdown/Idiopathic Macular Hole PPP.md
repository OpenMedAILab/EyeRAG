## OBJECTIVES OF PREFERRED PRACTICE PATTERN GUIDELINES
As a service to its members and the public, the American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed a series of Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that identify characteristics and components of quality eye care. Appendix 1 describes the core criteria of quality eye care.
The Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are based on the best available scientific data as interpreted by committees of knowledgeable health professionals. In some instances, such as when results of carefully conducted clinical trials are available, the data are particularly persuasive and provide clear guidance. In other instances, the committees have to rely on their collective judgment and evaluation of available evidence.
**These documents provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular individual.** While they should generally meet the needs of most patients, they cannot possibly best meet the needs of all patients. Adherence to these PPPs will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation. These practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results. It may be necessary to approach different patients' needs in different ways. The physician must make the ultimate judgment about the propriety of the care of a particular patient in light of all of the circumstances presented by that patient. The American Academy of Ophthalmology is available to assist members in resolving ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of ophthalmic practice.
Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual situations. The Academy specifically disclaims any and all liability for injury or other damages of any kind, from negligence or otherwise, for any and all claims that may arise out of the use of any recommendations or other information contained herein.
References to certain drugs, instruments, and other products are made for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to constitute an endorsement of such. Such material may include information on applications that are not considered community standard, that reflect indications not included in approved US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, or that are approved for use only in restricted research settings. The FDA has stated that it is the responsibility of the physician to determine the FDA status of each drug or device he or she wishes to use, and to use them with appropriate patient consent in compliance with applicable law.
Innovation in medicine is essential to ensure the future health of the American public, and the Academy encourages the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic methods that will improve eye care. It is essential to recognize that true medical excellence is achieved only when the patients' needs are the foremost consideration.
All Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are reviewed by their parent committee annually or earlier if developments warrant and updated accordingly. To ensure that all PPPs are current, each is valid for 5 years from the approved by date unless superseded by a revision. Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are funded by the Academy without commercial support. Authors and reviewers of PPPs are volunteers and do not receive any financial compensation for their contributions to the documents. The PPPs are externally reviewed by experts and stakeholders, including consumer representatives, before publication. The PPPs are developed in compliance with the Council of Medical Specialty Societies’ Code for Interactions with Companies. The Academy has Relationship with Industry Procedures (available at [www.aao.org/about-preferred-practice-patterns](http://www.aao.org/about-preferred-practice-patterns)) to comply with the Code.
The intended users of the Idiopathic Macular Hole PPP are ophthalmologists.
## METHODS AND KEY TO RATINGS
Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful information to practitioners. Where evidence exists to support a recommendation for care, the recommendation should be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence. To accomplish these aims, methods from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network1 (SIGN) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation2 (GRADE) group are used. GRADE is a systematic approach to grading the strength of the total body of evidence that is available to support recommendations on a specific clinical management issue. Organizations that have adopted GRADE include SIGN, the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Policy, and the American College of Physicians.3
- All studies used to form a recommendation for care are graded for strength of evidence individually, and that grade is listed with the study citation.
- To rate individual studies, a scale based on SIGN1 is used. The definitions and levels of evidence to rate individual studies are as follows:
    - **I++**: High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias
    - **I+**: Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias
    - **I−**: Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias
    - **II++**: High-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies
        - High-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal
    - **II+**: Well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal
    - **II−**: Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal
    - **III**: Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series)
- Recommendations for care are formed based on the body of the evidence. The body of evidence quality ratings are defined by GRADE2 as follows:
    - **Good quality**: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect
    - **Moderate quality**: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate
    - **Insufficient quality**: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Any estimate of effect is very uncertain
- Key recommendations for care are defined by GRADE2 as follows:
    - **Strong recommendation**: Used when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects or clearly do not
    - **Discretionary recommendation**: Used when the trade-offs are less certain—either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced
- The Highlighted Findings and Recommendations for Care section lists points determined by the Retina/Vitreous PPP Committee to be of particular importance to vision and quality of life outcomes.
- Recommendations for care in this PPP were rated using the system described above. Ratings are embedded throughout the PPP main text in italics.
- Literature searches to update the PPP were undertaken on March 6, 2023, January 23, 2024, and August 6, 2024 in PubMed. Complete details of the literature searches are available online at [www.aao.org/ppp](http://www.aao.org/ppp).
- Relevant systematic reviews were identified by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision US Satellite (CEV@US). These systematic reviews were screened by the committee and rated using the system described above by the committee methodologist.
- Recommendations are based on systematic reviews, as per the Institute of Medicine (Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust, 2011). In formulating the recommendations, the health benefits, side effects/harms/risks, and the balance of benefits and risks are reviewed and considered. Final decisions are recommendations by the committee.
arrived at through informal consensus techniques. If there are areas of disagreement, a vote will be conducted among the members of the Retina/Vitreous PPP Committee. If there are individuals with direct financial relationships in the area of disagreement, these individuals will refrain from the vote.
## HIGHLIGHTED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARE
Idiopathic macular holes are more common in females than in males and usually occur after age 55. There is a significant rate of macular hole formation in the fellow eye (10%–15%) in the 5-year period after a macular hole occurs in the first eye.
Patients with vitreous traction, good vision, and no macular hole (stage 1-A or 1-B) should be observed without treatment, because they often remain stable or even improve. Currently, there is no evidence that treatment improves their prognosis.
Most patients with stages 2, 3 and 4 macular holes will have a poor prognosis without treatment. The visual prognosis is good following successful macular hole closure. The benefits of treatment designed to achieve macular hole closure should be discussed.
Early detection of a macular hole is associated with a higher closure rate after vitrectomy and better postoperative visual acuity.
Studies report that approximately 90% of recent-onset (less than 6 months duration) macular holes that are 400 μm or smaller in diameter can be closed with vitrectomy surgery.
Careful removal of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) during vitrectomy surgery increases the macular hole closure rate without adversely affecting visual acuity.
Cataract development or progression is a frequent side effect of vitrectomy surgery to repair macular holes. This risk should be discussed with patients preoperatively, and postoperative monitoring is advised.
## INTRODUCTION
### DISEASE DEFINITION
A macular hole is a discontinuity of the neurosensory retina, located at the fovea or perifoveal region.
### PATIENT POPULATION
The patient population consists of adults often 55 years of age or older, most of whom are women, who have idiopathic macular holes. This is in contrast to traumatic macular holes, which tend to be in young men (20s and 30s), and the holes tend to be larger.
### CLINICAL OBJECTIVES
- Identify patients at risk for macular hole
- Educate high-risk patients about the reason for periodic monocular self-assessment and follow-up examination, the symptoms of a macular hole, and the need to return promptly should symptoms occur
- Follow patients who are at risk for vision loss from macular hole
- Inform patients of the risks and benefits of the treatment options for macular hole
- Optimize recovery of visual function
## BACKGROUND
A macular hole is an anatomic discontinuity of the neurosensory retina that develops in the center of the macula or fovea. Typically, the patient will experience metamorphopsia and decreased visual acuity, which may progress to a central scotoma as the macular hole enlarges. Most investigators believe that macular holes are caused by pathologic vitreoretinal traction at the fovea. Uncontrolled series also suggest that trauma may be responsible for a minority of macular hole cases. It is important to differentiate a full-thickness macular hole (FTMH) from a lamellar macular hole, which is a partial-thickness defect in the neurosensory retina. Full-thickness macular hole should also be differentiated from a macular pseudohole, a circular or oval configuration of the foveal depression that can result in perifoveal traction from an epiretinal membrane. A pseudohole has no retinal defect but can give the false clinical appearance of an FTMH. A contact lens examination or ancillary imaging study shows definitive differences between a pseudohole and an FTMH. In addition, visual acuity in patients with pseudoholes generally is excellent (i.e., 20/30 or better).
## EPIDEMIOLOGY
The Beijing Eye Study was a population-based cross-sectional study of 4436 subjects aged 40 or older that found an FTMH in eight eyes of seven subjects, which corresponds to a prevalence of 1.6 per 1000 Chinese people having a macular hole in this age range. Another population-based cross-sectional study in rural India of 4542 people aged 30 or older found a macular hole in 18 eyes of 13 subjects, which corresponds to a prevalence of 2.7 per 1000 people having a macular hole in this age range. In the United States, a population-based retrospective study of the largely Caucasian residents (>90%) of Olmsted County, Minnesota, estimated the age- and sex-adjusted incidence of macular holes to be 7.8 people and 8.7 eyes per 100,000 people (all ages) per year, with a female-to-male ratio of 3.3 to 1. In a case-control study, the majority (72%) of idiopathic macular holes occurred in women; more than 50% of holes were found in individuals 65 to 74 years of age and only 3% in those under the age of 55. The 5-year risk of a patient with an FTMH of developing an FTMH in the fellow eye was approximately 10% to 15%. However, fellow eyes with a complete posterior vitreous detachment have a lower risk of developing an FTMH. In one study, it was observed that no fellow eye with a complete posterior vitreous detachment developed an FTMH during a median follow-up period of 33 months (range, 9–99 months). A Korean population-based cohort study through the Korean National Health Insurance Service searched for risk factors for idiopathic macular hole development and found that macular holes occurred earlier and more often in women.
Childbirth was associated with a greater risk of macular holes, whereas obesity was associated with a lower risk of macular holes in both men and women.
## NATURAL HISTORY
The formation of a macular hole typically evolves over a period of weeks to months through the clinically defined stages first described by Gass, although some macular holes may develop more rapidly. In both cases, macular holes are frequently detected when the patient’s symptoms change relatively abruptly. The anatomic findings from optical coherence tomography (OCT) support Gass’ original observations, and an updated classification of the stages of development of FTMH is described in Table 1. Importantly, a full-thickness retinal defect is not present in stages 1-A and 1-B. Therefore, these stages may be better classified as impending macular holes.
#### TABLE 1 CLINICAL STAGES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MACULAR HOLES
| Stage      | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-A        | - Loss of the foveal depression and a yellowish foveal spot (100–200 µm in diameter) <br> - Localized shallow detachment of the perifoveal vitreous cortex with persistent adherence to the foveola <br> - Vitreofoveolar traction may horizontally separate (split) the retina at the fovea (pseudocyst) that corresponds to the yellow spot <br> - Epiretinal membranes are uncommon <br> - Visual acuity ranges from 20/25 to 20/80 |
| 1-B        | - Yellow ring 200–350 µm in diameter <br> - Posterior extension of the pseudocyst with disruption of the outer retinal layer <br> - The retinal roof remains intact with persistent adherence of the posterior hyaloid to the retina <br> - Epiretinal membranes are uncommon <br> - Visual acuity ranges from 20/25 to 20/80 |
| 2          | - Small full-thickness (<400 µm in diameter) retinal defect, often eccentric <br> - Epiretinal membranes are uncommon <br> - Visual symptoms include metamorphopsia and decreased vision <br> - Visual acuity 20/25 to 20/80 |
| 3          | - Full-thickness hole ≥400 µm in diameter <br> - The posterior hyaloid is separated from the macula but may remain attached at the optic disc and be attached more peripherally <br> - An operculum or a flap is present on the posterior hyaloid over the hole and is visible clinically or by means of optical coherence tomography <br> - A cuff of subretinal fluid may be detected along with intraretinal edema and cysts <br> - Drusen-like deposits* may be occasionally seen in the base of the hole <br> - A rim of retinal pigment epithelium hyper/hypo-pigmentation is often present at the junction between edematous or detached retina and normal-appearing attached retina in long-standing cases <br> - Epiretinal membranes may be present <br> - Visual acuity usually ranges from 20/100 to 20/400 |
| 4          | - A full-thickness hole with a diameter usually larger than stage 3 (>400 µm in diameter) <br> - A complete posterior vitreous detachment with a Weiss ring <br> - A cuff of subretinal fluid, intraretinal edema, and cystoid changes are usually present <br> - Drusen-like deposits* may be occasionally seen in the base of the hole <br> - Epiretinal membranes are more frequent <br> - Visual acuity usually ranges from 20/100 to 20/400 |
*Drusen-like or yellow deposits may represent macrophages at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium, suggesting chronicity of disease.
Figure 1 illustrates the stages of macular hole formation. Evidence provided by OCT, a retinal thickness analyzer, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, and observations made during vitrectomy suggests that vitreomacular traction (VMT) or vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) is likely responsible for a stage 1-A hole. Some impending holes may resolve spontaneously and completely, but a few may evolve into lamellar or partial-thickness holes. About 40% to 50% of pseudocysts characteristic of impending holes may progress over a period of weeks to months to an FTMH, often passing from stage 1-A through stage 1-B. Approximately 75% of stage 2 macular holes progress to stage 3 or stage 4 macular holes.

## The Prognosis of Idiopathic Macular Hole
The prognosis of untreated FTMHs is poor. Only 5% of eyes with an FTMH will have visual acuity of 20/50 or better, approximately 55% will have visual acuity of 20/100 or better, and 40% will have visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Sixty percent of eyes with an FTMH will lose 2 or more lines of vision over 5 years of follow-up. After a follow-up of 3 to 5 years, 70% to 80% of eyes will have 20/200 or worse visual acuity, and the visual acuity in the remaining 20% to 30% will usually be 20/70 to 20/100. In about 3% to 11% of cases, an FTMH will close spontaneously. If the hole closes spontaneously, the visual acuity may recover dramatically. The majority of eyes with untreated macular holes deteriorate to the 20/100 to 20/400 range and then stabilize with good peripheral vision.
Reports have identified characteristics of recent macular holes that may close with observation. These include holes smaller than 200 μm in diameter, holes with associated cystoid macular edema undergoing treatment (topical NSAIDS, steroids, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), and traumatic macular holes.
## CARE PROCESS
### PATIENT OUTCOME CRITERIA
Patient outcome criteria include the following:
- Prevention of visual loss and functional impairment
- Improvement of visual function
- Maintenance or improvement of quality of life
### DIAGNOSIS
The initial evaluation of a patient with symptoms and signs suggestive of macular hole includes all features of a comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation, with particular attention to those aspects relevant to macular hole. Conditions often mistaken for the various stages of macular hole include cystoid macular edema, central serous retinopathy, a subfoveal druse, lamellar macular hole, epiretinal membrane with pseudohole, macular telangiectasia with cavitary changes and solar maculopathy.
#### History
A complete history includes the following elements, although the exact composition varies according to the patient's particular symptomatology and specific needs.
- Duration of symptoms such as reduced visual acuity, metamorphopsia, floaters, micropsia, central scotoma
- Ocular history: glaucoma, retinal detachment or tear, other eye disease, eye or head injuries, ocular surgery, or sun or eclipse gazing or use of a laser pointer or other type of laser
- Medication use that may be related to cystoid macular edema (e.g., systemic niacin, topical prostaglandin analogues, topical epinephrine, tamoxifen)
#### Examination
Examination includes the following elements:
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the macula and vitreoretinal interface
- An indirect peripheral retinal examination
- Amsler grid test
- The Watzke-Allen sign can be used as a clinical test in cases of a suspected FTMH by shining a thin beam of light over the area of interest. The patient would perceive a “break” in the slit beam in cases of a positive test. (False-negative responses are not uncommon.)
## Ancillary Tests
Optical coherence tomography is extremely helpful and offers detailed information about the macular anatomy, size of the macular hole if an FTMH is present, and if there is a presence of any VMT or an epiretinal membrane. This information aids in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up. Optical coherence tomography images are also helpful with patient education. However, FTMHs are often readily apparent with slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the fundus.
## MANAGEMENT
### Prevention and Early Detection
At this time, there is no known prevention for the development of an idiopathic macular hole. Early detection of a macular hole and intervention with vitrectomy surgery is associated with both a higher macular hole closure rate after surgery as well as better postoperative visual acuity, perhaps because of the smaller size of the hole and a more limited duration of compromise to the macula. For these reasons, it is important to diagnose a macular hole in the fellow eye as soon as possible. Thus, patients should be educated about early warning signs such as metamorphopsia or any changes in central vision.
The initial evaluation should include a careful assessment of the fellow eye. The fellow eye may develop a macular hole in about 10% to 15% of patients, and fellow eyes are at higher risk of developing a macular hole when a definite posterior vitreous detachment cannot be confirmed. In contrast, the presence of a complete posterior vitreous detachment is associated with a decreased risk of fellow-eye macular hole formation.
Optical coherence tomography imaging can help to detect biomarkers for increased risk of macular hole formation in the fellow eye. These OCT biomarkers include outer retinal defects, inner foveal cysts, intraretinal pseudocysts, and vitreomacular traction. An OCT image of the macula of the fellow eye may also help to identify at-risk eyes, evident by the presence of vitreous traction at or near the center of the macula.
### Early Stages
Some people with stage 1-A or 1-B macular holes have foveal cystoid focal changes that may resolve completely without treatment. One study reported that patients with cystoid foveal changes can remain stable with good vision for up to 5 years. The visual acuity of patients with stage 1 macular hole (i.e., impending macular hole) may improve spontaneously when the posterior vitreous detaches from the central macula. Most patients who present with good central visual acuity can be followed and asked to return promptly if symptoms worsen.
Although stage 1-A and early stage 1-B lesions have been referred to as early or impending macular holes, only about 50% progress to an FTMH from persistent VMT. When the vitreous attachment spontaneously separates from the fovea in the other 50%, the appearance of the fovea either returns to normal or appears as a reddish spot and there is often a rapid improvement in visual symptoms. Previous studies suggested that surgery to prevent the development of an FTMH does not affect the rate of progression of an FTMH. However, recent vitrectomy studies indicate that release of VMT can be beneficial in eyes with VMT. In a DRCR Retina Network study of patients enrolled in Protocols AG and AH, pneumatic vitreolysis was shown to be ineffective.
### Later Stages
When the macular hole progresses beyond stage 2, further vision loss will occur if the patient does not receive treatment. Moreover, as the macular hole enlarges, an epiretinal membrane may develop and the success rate of macular hole closure with vitrectomy surgery may decrease. A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis in 2015 demonstrated the benefit of vitrectomy on improving visual acuity outcomes and increasing macular hole closure rates.
**(Strong recommendation, moderate quality)**
Table 2 delineates management recommendations for each of the stages of macular hole.

|-------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-A and 1-B | Observation<sup>17</sup>            | - Follow up at 2- to 4-month intervals in the absence of new visual symptoms<br>- Recommend prompt return if new visual symptoms develop<br>- Encourage monocular vision testing with Amsler grid |
| 2           | Pneumatic vitreolysis<sup>56, 61, 62</sup> | - Performed usually within a few weeks to months of diagnosis<br>- Follow up at 1–2 days, then 1 week or sooner if new visual symptoms<br>- Frequency and timing of subsequent visits vary depending on the outcome of surgery and the patient’s clinical course |
| 2           | Vitreoretinal surgery<sup>42</sup>  | - Performed usually within a few weeks to months of diagnosis to minimize risk of progression of macular hole and vision loss<br>- Routine postoperative follow-up at 1–2 days, then 1–2 weeks during which time strict face-down positioning may be advised<br>- Frequency and timing of subsequent postoperative visits vary depending on the outcome of surgery and the patient’s clinical course |
| 3 or 4      | Vitreoretinal surgery               | - Performed usually within a few weeks to a few months of diagnosis<br>- Postoperative follow-up at 1–2 days, then 1–2 weeks during which time strict face-down positioning is advised<br>- Frequency and timing of subsequent visits vary depending on the outcome of surgery and the patient’s clinical course |
*Several small case series have shown promising results using this technique for smaller holes.*
<sup>†</sup>Although surgery is usually performed, observation may also be appropriate in selected cases such as smaller holes and/or better visual acuity.
## Surgical Management
### Preoperative Discussion
The preoperative discussion should include the following information:
- The natural history of most eyes with an untreated FTMH (stages 2–4) is progressive loss of central vision resulting in visual acuity in the 20/200 to 20/400 range. The peripheral vision is usually unaffected. Delays in repair of macular hole may result in reduced success of hole closure and visual benefit.
- The risk of developing a macular hole in the fellow eye if the vitreous is attached to the macula is 10% to 15%; the risk is lower if the vitreous appears detached.
- There is a remote chance for spontaneous macular hole closure. If this happens, there may be visual gain depending on the duration and size of the macular hole.
- Occasionally, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and corticosteroid therapy may result in closure of small macular holes (anecdotal reports).<sup>65-67</sup>
- Vision does not typically return to “normal” even after successful hole closure. Metamorphopsia, micropsia, macropsia, and decreased vision may persist indefinitely.
- Phacovitrectomy could be considered.<sup>68</sup>
- The option to use intravitreal expansile gas to treat a macular hole should be discussed if the eye has an associated VMT. The discussion should include detailed risks and benefits for each option relative to vitrectomy surgery and continued observation. The expected visual outcome of successful hole closure should also be discussed, including residual visual blur and metamorphopsia that will likely persist after hole closure.
## Vitrectomy
For surgery, the discussion should include the following:
- The type of anesthesia required. (Usually, monitored anesthesia care is provided with a local anesthetic.) Macular hole surgery can be performed under general anesthesia for anxious or claustrophobic patients.
- The use of nitrous oxide gas. It should be avoided at least during the last 10 minutes of the air-fluid exchange when general anesthesia is used because it may result in an unpredictable gas fill as well as an intraocular pressure (IOP) increase followed by an IOP decrease postoperatively.
- The risks (e.g., cataract, retinal tears) versus benefits of vitrectomy surgery.
- The role of positioning postoperatively. Detailed instructions about head positioning postoperatively to tamponade the macular hole and minimize the risk of developing a cataract in phakic eyes should be discussed prior to scheduling surgery. Information can be given about equipment that can be rented or purchased for postoperative positioning.
- The possibility of an increase in postoperative IOP. The surgeon should inform patients about this possibility. To minimize the risk, patients should be advised about the importance of maintaining their scheduled postoperative examination visits and avoiding travel (including airplane travel) to higher altitudes (1000 feet), especially above 2000 feet altitude. Severe and sustained elevations in IOP can result in permanent vision loss, especially in patients with glaucoma. The surgeon is responsible for formulating a postoperative care plan and should inform the patient of these arrangements.
## Detaching the Posterior Vitreous
An important anatomic goal of the pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for macular hole closure is to separate the posterior cortical hyaloid from the retinal surface of the macula. Surgeons have individual preferences or techniques to accomplish the surgical objectives. Triamcinolone acetonide or other commonly used intraoperative dyes such as ICG and BBG (see Internal Limiting Membrane Removal and Dyes section) can be injected into the vitreous following a core vitrectomy to highlight the posterior vitreous. Iatrogenic retinal breaks may develop in eyes with macular holes, often during the creation of a posterior vitreous detachment. This is a risk for highly myopic patients in particular. Thus, a scleral depressed examination of the peripheral retina for breaks or tears should be performed intraoperatively prior to air-fluid exchange to minimize the risk of postoperative retinal detachment.
## Internal Limiting Membrane Removal and Dyes
Another unsettled controversy is the value of removing the internal limiting membrane (ILM) during surgery. The ILM may act as a scaffold for cellular proliferation or attachment of contractile tissue elements that may cause persistent VMT after vitrectomy. Thus, failure of the original vitrectomy surgery to close the macular hole or late reopening of initially successfully closed holes may occur without removal of the ILM. On the other hand, loss of its structural role or secondary collateral nerve fiber layer loss during removal may result in a dissociated optic nerve fiber layer appearance or paracentral retinal holes.
A large meta-analysis of 5480 cases concluded that ILM peeling at the time of surgery significantly reduces the likelihood of the holes reopening but does not result in better postoperative best corrected visual acuities (BCVAs).
#### TABLE 3
Table 3 summarizes large case series and randomized controlled trials that compared macular hole closure rates following vitrectomies when the ILM was either peeled or not peeled.

A meta-analysis of four randomized control trials that included 317 patients with stages 2, 3, and 4 idiopathic FTMHs found that ILM peeling achieves higher anatomical success with a reduced need for additional surgical interventions when compared with nonpeeling in patients with stages 2, 3, and 4 macular holes.84 One study in 2016 evaluated a small group of eyes that compared the extent of the ILM peel and evaluated outcomes. This study did show there was less metamorphopsia associated with wider ILM peel.86 The use of inverted ILM flaps and ILM-free flaps are effective techniques for addressing idiopathic, myopic, and large macular holes, with resultant improved functional and anatomical outcomes.86-89 A systematic review of four small randomized controlled trials concluded that the inverted ILM flap technique may be superior to ILM peeling for BCVA gain after 3 months; however, evidence was noted to be of low certainty. Moderate certainty evidence supported that the ILM flap technique achieved more hole closures.90 (II, Moderate quality)
A cost-effectiveness analysis was also performed alongside an RCT and concluded that ILM peeling is a cost-effective treatment for FTMH compared with no peeling over a 6-month period.91 It was based on the higher number of reoperations required in the no-peel arm of the trial.
Indocyanine green (ICG), brilliant blue G ophthalmic solution (BBG) (Tissue Blue™, Dutch Ophthalmic USA, Exeter, NH), and other dyes, as well as triamcinolone acetonide have been reported to optimize visualization of the ILM during surgery.92-96 Trypan blue stains epiretinal membranes better than ILM and is not generally used for ILM staining. Brilliant blue G selectively stains the ILM. It comprises a highly purified preparation of 0.025% BBG mixed with 4% polyethylene glycol to produce a heavier-than-water solution.
... and thus “sinks” to the macular surface when injected into the vitreous cavity. There have been reports of possible toxicity with all of these agents.
92-94, 96-101
Importantly, when the surgeon chooses to use ICG to stain the ILM, efforts should be made to avoid unnecessarily high concentrations and prolonged exposure. Furthermore, although BBG has been thought of as generally safe, it has been associated with toxicity in a few case reports as has triamcinolone acetonide.
102, 103
Macular and choriocapillary atrophy have been reported after prolonged focal endoillumination
104
and repeated dye staining. The lowest level of illumination should be used and repeated dye staining should be avoided to minimize this risk.
### Anatomic Closure
Retinal tamponade may be created by intravitreal injection of different agents at the conclusion of macular hole surgery to achieve anatomic closure of the macular hole. In general, there is no consensus about the best choice of tamponade agent. Tamponade options include the use of air (lasting days), SF6 (lasting about 2–3 weeks), C3F8 (lasting about 6–8 weeks), or silicone oil (lasting long term but requires removal).
78, 105-111
Although holes may be closed with silicone oil, anatomic and visual results are better with gas tamponade.
112
Postoperatively, patients may have ellipsoid zone loss in the area of the previous macular hole and may note distortions centrally, even after surgical repair.
A single-arm meta-analysis and systematic review paper from 2023 evaluated the efficacy and complications of human amniotic membrane (hAM) grafts used in the management of refractory macular holes and concluded that the grafts may be beneficial.
113
However, limitations of the study included an absence of controlled studies and small sample sizes.
Retinal full-thickness transplants and adjuvants have been used to repair macular holes, particularly recurrent or large macular holes.
114-116
At present, there is limited evidence for the efficacy of these procedures.
### Positioning
In the early days of macular hole surgery, patients were instructed to maintain a face-down position for 10 to 14 days postoperatively to optimize macular hole closure. Postoperative prone positioning is uncomfortable for the patient, even though immobilization is not required. In some patients, positioning may be extremely difficult or even lead to pressure sores or neuropathy.
117-119
Studies have reported excellent results using face-down positioning for 1 to 3 days.
108, 120, 121
Surgeons have reported closure rates with no face-down positioning that are similar to the rates seen in series requiring face-down positioning.
122-128
A small comparative study was published comparing facedown positioning to not being face down and found that differences in positioning had no effect on the macular hole closure rate.
129
In all of these studies, however, the patient was told to avoid the face-up or supine positioning. Specifically, recommendations were for an upright position that avoided the head tilting back.
126, 128
Additionally, some advocates of this approach have emphasized the importance of a good postoperative gas fill to allow for tamponade of the macular hole without prone positioning.
130
Longer positioning may be required for holes larger than 400 ㎛ or those with inadequate tamponade.
72, 126
Extended duration of face-down positioning minimizes the risk of cataract progression and provides some tamponade of the macular hole.
Some studies have monitored the timeline of macular hole closure by obtaining OCT imaging of the macula within days of vitrectomy surgery (through the gas-filled vitreous cavity) and used that information to curtail positioning.
131-135
A meta-analysis of 251 cases concluded that no-face-down positioning had similar results to face-down positioning for holes smaller than 400 ㎛, but face-down positioning may be beneficial for holes larger than 400 ㎛.
136
(*+, Good quality, Discretionary recommendation*)
Another meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials concluded that face-down positioning was not necessary for small holes but may be recommended for holes larger than 400 ㎛.
137
(*+, Moderate quality, Discretionary recommendation*)
A meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled trials that included 709 eyes concluded that face-down positioning may have ...
## Outcomes of Surgery
Two multicenter, randomized, controlled trials provide evidence for the efficacy of surgery compared with observation for FTMH. One study of 120 patients with stage 3 and stage 4 macular holes reported a benefit from vitrectomy surgery in the closure rate and visual acuity 6 months after randomization. However, results with stage 2 macular holes did not demonstrate a similar benefit. Nevertheless, the consensus of the vitreoretinal community is to recommend surgery for a stage 2 macular hole, not only the visual acuity results are good with surgery but also to try to minimize further risk of visual loss that accompanies progression to a stage 3 or stage 4 macular hole. However, observation with close follow-up is also recommended for early-stage macular holes. For a stage 1 macular hole, a randomized controlled study showed that 60% may not progress to a FTMH and that vitrectomy surgery did not prevent the progression of stage 1 macular holes. With OCT imaging, the physician is able to monitor the progress of early-stage macular holes and make appropriate treatment recommendations.
Surgical studies have reported closure rates of 91% to 98% for FTMHs. Most articles have reported that the median postoperative visual acuity of sealed macular holes is approximately 20/40, clearly better than the visual acuity of untreated macular holes. However, patients may have elliptical zone loss in the area of the previous macular hole postoperatively and may note some distortion in central vision even after successful surgical repair of the macular hole. Visual acuity can improve up to 3 years after macular surgery and improvement was maintained for 5 to 10 years.
## Predictors of Visual Results
In case series, earlier studies have reported better closure rates and better visual outcomes when the duration of symptoms is less than 6 months. Findings from case series indicate that a macular hole that has been present for more than 2 to 3 years may be closed, yet the success rate is lower (63%) and visual acuity outcomes are worse than for macular holes of shorter duration. A systematic review of 12 RCTs with a total of 940 eyes found that each additional month of symptoms was associated with worsening BCVA by 0.008 logMAR units (i.e., 1 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letter loss per 2 months) and better baseline BCVA, face-down positioning, smaller FTMH, ILM peeling, ILM flap use were associated with higher rates of primary macular hole closure.
Patients whose macular holes fail to seal after the first surgery usually have a less favorable visual acuity outcome when compared with primary closure. Two studies have shown that up to 70% of these macular holes close following additional vitrectomy surgery, but visual gain may be reduced. An improvement of only 1 line in visual acuity and an approximate visual acuity of 20/100 were reported. On the other hand, patients whose macular holes closed following the initial surgery but then required additional vitrectomy for a reopened macular hole did better than those who required additional surgery to achieve primary macular hole closure. A review of 20 randomized controlled trials found that duration of symptoms was associated with both visual and anatomic outcomes, and that intraocular tamponade using long-acting gas, better preoperative BCVA, smaller hole size, and phakic status were associated with an improved postoperative BCVA.
## Complications of Vitrectomy
### Recurrence of Macular Hole
Up to 10% of successfully closed macular holes later reopen, although this risk might be less when the ILM is peeled during the vitrectomy to close the hole.
## Cataract
The vast majority of phakic eyes in adults develop cataracts after macular hole surgery. A clinically significant cataract develops in over 80% of phakic eyes within the first few years after vitrectomy. One study found that the median time to cataract surgery after vitrectomy for a macular hole was 14 months and that 98% of eyes needed cataract surgery when followed for a mean of 91 months after vitrectomy. One study showed a high rate of 11% of closed macular holes reopening after cataract surgery and that the development of cystoid macular edema after cataract surgery increased the risk of reopening the macular hole by sevenfold. Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses did not find a difference in visual gain and closure rate between combined surgery and sequential surgery. *(i.e., Insufficient quality, Discretionary recommendation)* Given the rate of cataract formation and risk of reopening of the macular hole, some surgeons advocate combining macular hole surgery with phacoemulsification and placement of an intraocular lens. A combined procedure eliminates the need for two operations and may allow for a more complete gas fill. The potential complications of combining cataract surgery with vitrectomy include hypotony, intraocular lens-iris capture, and possibly an increased risk of macular edema in some patients.
## Retinal Tears
Intraoperative retinal tears have been reported in 3% to 17% of macular hole operations, and most occur inferiorly.
## Retinal Detachment
Although postoperative retinal detachment has been reported to be as high as 14% of cases, most series report an incidence of 1% to 5%. Detachment is typically located inferiorly and caused by small tears at the posterior vitreous base. Fortunately, most detachments can be repaired without reopening of the macular hole.
## Visual Field Loss
In the past, up to 20% of patients were noted to have permanent temporal visual field loss after macular hole surgery. Most ophthalmologists believe that this field loss was caused by either mechanical injury (such as trauma to the peripapillary retinal vasculature or nerve fiber layer) or dehydration damage to the retina as a result of air streaming from the temporally placed infusion cannula during the air-fluid exchange. It is unknown whether the following surgical recommendations have reduced the incidence of visual field loss:
- Minimize direct instrument contact with optic disc during air-fluid exchange
- Minimize prolonged air flow at high pressure
- Securely close the sclerotomies to minimize air flow through the eye during the air-fluid exchange
- Leave fluid posteriorly until the final aspiration
- Humidify the air
- Use a low-infusion pressure during air-fluid exchange
In addition, it is possible that the air flow through the vitreous cavity is decreased in small-gauge vitrectomy or by incorporating valved cannulas that decrease air circulation. Visual field sensitivity within 10° of fixation may deteriorate after vitrectomy with ILM peeling for treatment of macular holes in glaucomatous eyes. In a retrospective review of 54 consecutive cases of open-angle glaucoma, eyes that underwent PPV for macular hole or epiretinal membrane, mean visual field sensitivity decreased reproducibly in contrast to 45 nonglaucomatous control eyes. Risk factors for this visual field loss included older age, longer axial length, higher medication scores, and systemic hypertension.
## Endophthalmitis
Endophthalmitis has been reported in less than 0.05% of vitrectomies, including those performed for macular holes.¹⁶¹, ¹⁶²
## Gas-Related Complications
Patients who have retinal tamponade achieved by an intravitreal injection of gas bubble must take special precautions for the duration that the gas bubble is in the eye. This includes avoiding air travel and driving or ascending to a higher altitude. Surgeons should also discuss the implications of travel to higher altitudes of more than 1000 feet from the site of the operation. For example, driving to or ascending to a higher altitude, including airplane travel, will result in gas expansion and result in increased IOP.
Bubble expansion at higher altitude causes increased IOP that could risk arterial occlusion, wound dehiscence, gas leakage, or other IOP-related injury.¹⁸⁹ Care must also be taken when traveling to lower elevations because reduction in bubble size may increase the risk of ocular hypotony and postsurgical retinal detachment.¹⁹⁰ Intraocular gas also limits the type of anesthetic agents that can be used. Most surgeons require their patients to wear a wristband warning alert that states the wearer’s eye contains intraocular gas and that general anesthetics (e.g., nitrous oxide) should be avoided. The use of nitrous oxide in a patient with intraocular gas may result in a dangerous rise in IOP.¹⁹⁰
## Follow-up Evaluation after Surgery
Patients who have surgery are usually examined the first 1 to 2 days postoperatively and again approximately 1 to 2 weeks following surgery. The frequency and timing of subsequent postoperative visits varies, depending on the outcome of surgery and the patient’s symptoms. Components of the follow-up visit should include the following:
- Interval history, including new symptoms
- Visual acuity measurement
- Measurement of IOP
- Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior chamber and central retina, and indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy of the peripheral retina
- OCT to document the postoperative macular anatomy
## PROVIDER AND SETTING
Diagnosis and management of macular holes requires expertise, skills, and specialized equipment to detect alterations in the retina and then select, perform, and/or monitor the appropriate treatment regimen. Referral to an ophthalmologist who has expertise and experience in managing this condition is recommended (i.e., a fellowship-trained vitreoretinal surgeon). The performance of certain diagnostic procedures is often delegated to appropriately trained and supervised personnel. However, the interpretation of the results of the diagnostic procedures, as well as the medical and surgical management of a macular hole, require medical training, clinical judgment, and experience.
## COUNSELING AND REFERRAL
Patients should be informed to notify their ophthalmologist promptly when they have new visual symptoms such as an increase in floaters, a loss of visual field, metamorphopsia, or a decrease in visual acuity.¹⁹¹⁻¹⁹³ The goal of vision rehabilitation is to restore functional ability.¹⁹⁴ Patients with function-limiting postoperative visual impairment should be referred for vision rehabilitation and social services.¹⁸⁷, ¹⁹⁵ Empathic communication and questioning by the provider is helpful to elicit patient concerns. Referrals for counseling, vocational rehabilitation, and or peer support groups for patients with depression, anxiety, and loss of independence or employment should be considered.¹⁹⁶ More information on vision rehabilitation, including materials for patients, is available at [www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab](http://www.aao.org/low-vision-and-vision-rehab).
## SOCIOECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
The economic considerations related to treatment and management of idiopathic macular hole have not been comprehensively studied. Measures of patient satisfaction after surgery correlate with the visual and anatomic results. Vision-related quality of life, assessed by the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25, has been reported to improve following surgery for idiopathic macular hole.
## APPENDIX 1. QUALITY OF OPHTHALMIC CARE CORE CRITERIA
*Providing quality care
is the physician’s foremost ethical obligation, and is
the basis of public trust in physicians.*
**AMA Board of Trustees, 1986**
Quality ophthalmic care is provided in a manner and with the skill that is consistent with the best interests of the patient. The discussion that follows characterizes the core elements of such care.
The ophthalmologist is first and foremost a physician. As such, the ophthalmologist demonstrates compassion and concern for the individual and utilizes the science and art of medicine to help alleviate patient fear and suffering. The ophthalmologist strives to develop and maintain clinical skills at the highest feasible level, consistent with the needs of patients, through training and continuing education. The ophthalmologist evaluates those skills and medical knowledge in relation to the needs of the patient and responds accordingly. The ophthalmologist also ensures that needy patients receive necessary care directly or through referral to appropriate persons and facilities that will provide such care, and he or she supports activities that promote health and prevent disease and disability.
The ophthalmologist recognizes that disease places patients in a disadvantaged, dependent state. The ophthalmologist respects the dignity and integrity of his or her patients and does not exploit their vulnerability.
Quality ophthalmic care has the following optimal attributes, among others.
- The essence of quality care is a meaningful partnership relationship between patient and physician. The ophthalmologist strives to communicate effectively with his or her patients, listening carefully to their needs and concerns. In turn, the ophthalmologist educates his or her patients about the nature and prognosis of their condition and about appropriate therapeutic modalities. This is to ensure their meaningful participation (appropriate to their unique physical, intellectual, and emotional state) in decisions affecting their management and care, to improve their motivation and compliance with the agreed plan of treatment, and to help alleviate their fears and concerns.
- The ophthalmologist uses his or her best judgment in choosing and timing appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic modalities as well as the frequency of evaluation and follow-up, with due regard to the urgency and nature of the patient's condition and unique needs and desires.
- The ophthalmologist carries out only those procedures for which he or she is adequately trained, experienced, and competent, or, when necessary, is assisted by someone who is, depending on the urgency of the problem and availability and accessibility of alternative providers.
- Patients are assured access to, and continuity of, needed and appropriate ophthalmic care, which can be described as follows:
  - The ophthalmologist treats patients with due regard to timeliness, appropriateness, and his or her own ability to provide such care.
  - The operating ophthalmologist makes adequate provision for appropriate pre- and postoperative patient care.
  - When the ophthalmologist is unavailable for his or her patient, he or she provides appropriate alternate ophthalmic care, with adequate mechanisms for informing patients of the existence of such care and procedures for obtaining it.
  - The ophthalmologist refers patients to other ophthalmologists and eye care providers based on the timeliness and appropriateness of such referral, the patient's needs, the competence and qualifications of the person to whom the referral is made, and access and availability.
- The ophthalmologist seeks appropriate consultation with due regard to the nature of the ocular or other medical or surgical problem. Consultants are suggested for their skill, competence, and accessibility. They receive as complete and accurate an accounting of the problem as necessary to provide efficient and effective advice or intervention, and in turn they respond in an adequate and timely manner. The ophthalmologist maintains complete and accurate medical records.
- On appropriate request, the ophthalmologist provides a full and accurate rendering of the patient’s records in his or her possession.
- The ophthalmologist reviews the results of consultations and laboratory tests in a timely and effective manner and takes appropriate actions.
- The ophthalmologist and those who assist in providing care identify themselves and their profession.
- For patients whose conditions fail to respond to treatment and for whom further treatment is unavailable, the ophthalmologist provides proper professional support, counseling, rehabilitative and social services, and referral as appropriate and accessible.
- Prior to therapeutic or invasive diagnostic procedures, the ophthalmologist becomes appropriately conversant with the patient’s condition by collecting pertinent historical information and performing relevant preoperative examinations. Additionally, he or she enables the patient to reach a fully informed decision by providing an accurate and truthful explanation of the diagnosis; the nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and probability of success of the proposed treatment and of alternative treatment; and the risks and benefits of no treatment.
- The ophthalmologist adopts new technology (e.g., drugs, devices, surgical techniques) in judicious fashion, appropriate to the cost and potential benefit relative to existing alternatives and to its demonstrated safety and efficacy.
- The ophthalmologist enhances the quality of care he or she provides by periodically reviewing and assessing his or her personal performance in relation to established standards, and by revising or altering his or her practices and techniques appropriately.
- The ophthalmologist improves ophthalmic care by communicating to colleagues, through appropriate professional channels, knowledge gained through clinical research and practice. This includes alerting them to instances of unusual or unexpected proud clinical outcomes and problems related to new drugs, devices, or procedures.
- The ophthalmologist provides care in suitably staffed and equipped facilities adequate to deal with potential ocular and systemic complications requiring immediate attention.
- The ophthalmologist also provides ophthalmic care in a manner that is cost effective without unacceptably compromising accepted standards of quality.
